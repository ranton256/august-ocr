To my friends and countrymen:

Having been urged from many quarters to set down the memories of my life as well as the events of the year ’48, insofar as they touched me personally, and to publish these recollections, I hereby fulfill the wish of my friends and ask only your kind indulgence if my descriptions lack elegance. Well then, I will do the best I can.

Once upon a time, many, many years ago, in the old city of Zerbst, in the beautiful land of Anhalt in the German homeland, a sturdy boy was born to an honest carpenter and his good wife. This boy was later baptized in the Reformed church and received the name August. Now, I cannot honestly remember all the details; only this much was clear to me: that I must be August. The boy grew up; he relished food and drink; and when, in his youthful way, he committed foolish pranks, he often received quite sensible reminders from his father or his mother.

At six, I was sent to a so‑called “Winkel School” (a small corner school) run by an old cantor’s widow named Dürre, assisted by her already well‑grown daughter, Auguste. Later, when the City Council of Zerbst had a grand, stately building erected and designated it a public school, all school‑aged children, from five to fourteen, were to attend it, and the Winkel School ceased operation. At the entrance examination I received a report: “Accepted into first grade on a trial basis!” I went there for the next five years and, in the last two, I was the top student.

In 1844 I was confirmed, and now it was time to choose a profession for life. I would have loved to become a fur tanner; however, I was unable to find a master to take me on. In 1842 I had begun working with my mother’s brother, who was a master in the fur‑tanning trade, helping there in my free hours when I was not in school. I had first to be confirmed, but before that could happen, he died; and since I could not find another master, though I tried very hard, I began an apprenticeship with Franz Wiegand, the best cabinetmaker around. The apprenticeship lasted four years. On 8 June 1848, after passing my apprentice’s examination, I was declared a journeyman cabinetmaker, and the sitting court assessor received my oath and handshake and enjoined me to travel to foreign parts, to see other cities and countries, so that, when the time came, I might become a capable master of the trade and a good citizen. That I have faithfully done; but before I tell of it, I would first like to speak a bit about the beautiful land of Anhalt and then about the events of the year ’48.

Now, during the fair pre‑March (Vormärz) period, the reigning princes of our German fatherland were the Alpha and Omega—the be‑all and end‑all—the sun around which everything revolved; and I would beg leave to describe a few of our former sovereigns. Albrecht the Bear, a mighty warrior under God, was the founder of the dynasty. I suppose there would be little interest if I were to recite the entire family tree. We’ll talk a little about the Old Dessauer, the “Old Mustache,” who was a successful general under two emperors and two kings. He played a foolish prank in the eyes of his—

Notes and small choices I made:
- Replaced OCR slips like “|” and “/” with I; “and of Anhalt” to “land of Anhalt”; normalized capitalization and punctuation.
- “Oraper by his mistress” interpreted as “carpenter and his good wife.” If the father was a different trade (e.g., draper) please tell me and I’ll adjust.
- “Kantor widow” modernized to “cantor’s widow”; preserved “Winkel School” with a brief gloss.
- “Carpenter officer” corrected to “journeyman cabinetmaker” (likely from German Geselle and earlier “cabinetmaker”).
- “Court assessor… took my word and handshake” rendered as “received my oath and handshake and enjoined me,” the customary guild phrasing.
- “A and O” glossed as “Alpha and Omega—the be‑all and end‑all.”
- I stopped where your text cuts off.

If you want a more modernized style (less antique phrasing), I can provide that too.",83.50634574890137,0.5248771498771498,0.5868852459016394,images/IMG_8479.jpg,True,3.186800956726074,80.3195447921753,820.0,1037.0,0.011394999999999999

He made her a reigning princess and lived with her happily for a long time, and their marriage was blessed with many children.

To possess her, he would stop at nothing; he even stabbed her alleged lover, whom he once found kneeling before her. For such an act a common mortal would have been punished as a murderer, but since he stood under God’s grace, he was allowed to do this.

In the evening with the virgins in their bedroom!

Even on his deathbed they had to play this melody for him, and he shouted the words along until his last breath.

As for his successor, Franz—called Father Franz by all his subjects—he was a frugal, people-loving prince who had only the welfare of his subjects at heart and opposed all military action. His favorite pastime was to travel the land on foot, visiting each village and town. He visited every school to satisfy himself of the teachers’ competence and the students’ progress. He walked every street and lane and spoke with all he met, whether rich or poor, noble or common.

His successor, Duke Leopold Friedrich, was again the opposite. He was shy and reclusive, did not care for governing, and left everything to his advisers, who exploited the land and its citizens in the most shameless way. His only passion was hunting; he spent his days riding back and forth through the woods. It is no wonder, then, that in 1848 the oppressed people welcomed the Revolution.

Still, I want to tell of a princess from Anhalt who was destined to play a great role in world history. She was chosen to be the wife of the Russian Emperor Paul [sic; historically Peter III], and when he died—a rather insignificant man—she became Empress of Russia under the name Catherine II. World history teaches us that she greatly enlarged the Russian state and extended its borders, reaching the highest rung on the ladder of power. Therefore, she was called “Catherine the Great.” The famous historian Johannes von Mueller says of her: “She was great, if greatness could …”

Notes:
- Likely corrections: Catherine the Great (Catherine II) was married to Peter III, not Paul; she became Empress, not Emperor.
- “Year 48” clarified as 1848.
- “Dessauer March” retained as a proper name.",91.79538249969482,0.3771615008156607,0.4702702702702703,images/IMG_8480.jpg,True,3.257338762283325,88.5380437374115,775.0,804.0,0.00900875

because when she saw a man whom she liked, he had to be at her will or else it
would have cost him his head.

ook nt close the characterization of some of the princes of Anhalt, now we will
places to med at the causes which led to sucha general people uprising and in many
@ bloody revolution. In the year 1847 all food in Germany was very,
very expensive. A bushel of rye cost five Thalers, a price which was unattainable,
because alf wages were so low and all earnings so low, as to where the mass of the
People had to go hungry, while the officials lived high on the hog. In the spring of the
same year, | had to go to work, together with several of our journeymen, ata mill for
fourteen weeks. The milf was called Amts Mill, located near the city of Zerbst.
There, we did not feel anything of the expensive times, we had plenty to eat, and
when we were finished there, we went to Jochheim, a forestry located near the Elbe
river, about three hours from Zerbst. The forester’s name was Ganzer and his ranger,
a unique individual first class, was called Fritz Otto. As good as life was at the mill,
at the forestry we lived like masters. Here is the menu: early, six o‘clock, coffee,
Sugar, milk, butter and hard rolls in masses. At eight o'clock breakfast, bread, butter,
coffee, ham, meat and beer, and for master and journeymen brandy too. /, as an
apprentice, did not get any brandy. At eleven thirty was lunch. Soup, vegetables,
meat, roast, salad, bread, beer and brandy. At two o'clock, coffee, sugar, butter and
hard rolls. At four o'clock was afternoon snack. Bread, butter, wurst and such, beer
and brandy. At six thirty was dinner; again roast, bread, butter, cheese, meat, beer
and brandy and at each meal everything was available in masses. See! such was the
live of the officials. At this site, the poor workmen had their mouths and noses wide
open. No wonder that unhappiness reigned all through the land and the question
arose. Aren't we commoners and workers human beings too, are we only here to
carry the load and pay taxes? The old forester Ganzer and his wife were the most
deserving people in the world. She, the forester’s wife, always asked us to go into
the garden and to pick for ourselves there berries, fruit and grapes as much as we
liked, there was plenty of all of these things there, so we did not have to go hungry.
The forester was a very friendly and entertaining man and each evening, when he was
not absent, all people who lived in the house and in the neighborhood gathered
outside.

Mr. Forester sat in the middle, everyone listened with attention. Then he finally
began. Now / have to tell you a story, you have probably never heard one like it in
your entire life, a story of the poisonous tree on the island Celebes and he elaborated
long and wide about the terrible consequences the fumes of this poisonous tree had.
The birds fell as corpses dead from the air; wild animals, which roamed near the
poisonous tree, collapsed dead and the people, who dared to get close to it because
of ignorance, also had to die and this way, during the course of many years, sO many
corpses had gathered near the tree, so that the resulting poisonous smell due to the
decomposition of the corpses made it impossible for any living creature to live on the
island. And as long as we were there, he told this same story every evening as if it
was news and everybody listened with suspense as if they had never heard it in their
life before and exclamations of amazement and of surprise were loudly heard. After

She was thought of without any moral value. He probably means all her love affairs, because when she saw a man she liked, he had to be at her will, or it might have cost him his head.

Now, having closed the characterization of some of the princes of Anhalt, we will look at the causes that led to such a general popular uprising and, in many places, a bloody revolution. In 1847, food in Germany was very, very expensive. A bushel of rye cost five thalers, a price that was unattainable because wages and earnings were so low that the masses had to go hungry, while the officials lived high on the hog. In the spring of the same year, I had to go to work, together with several of our journeymen, at a mill for fourteen weeks. The mill was called Amts Mill, located near the city of Zerbst. There, we did not feel the effects of the high prices; we had plenty to eat. When we were finished there, we went to Jochheim, a forestry station near the Elbe River, about three hours from Zerbst. The forester’s name was Ganzer, and his ranger—a unique fellow, first class—was called Fritz Otto. As good as life was at the mill, at the forestry we lived like masters. Here was the daily fare:

- 6:00 a.m.: coffee, sugar, milk, butter, and plenty of hard rolls.
- 8:00 a.m. (breakfast): bread, butter, coffee, ham, meat, and beer; the master and journeymen had brandy as well. I, as an apprentice, did not get any brandy.
- 11:30 a.m. (lunch): soup, vegetables, meat, roast, salad, bread, beer, and brandy.
- 2:00 p.m.: coffee, sugar, butter, and hard rolls.
- 4:00 p.m. (afternoon snack): bread, butter, wurst and the like, beer, and brandy.
- 6:30 p.m. (dinner): roast again, bread, butter, cheese, meat, beer, and brandy.

At each meal, everything was available in abundance. Such was the life of the officials. Meanwhile, the poor workmen stood there with their mouths open. No wonder unhappiness reigned throughout the land, and the question arose: Aren’t we commoners and workers human beings too? Are we here only to carry the load and pay taxes?

The old forester Ganzer and his wife were the most deserving people in the world. The forester’s wife always asked us to go into the garden and pick berries, fruit, and grapes as much as we liked; there was plenty of everything, so we did not have to go hungry. The forester was a very friendly and entertaining man, and each evening, when he was at home, everyone who lived in the house and in the neighborhood gathered outside.

Mr. Forester sat in the middle; everyone listened attentively. Then he would begin: Now I have to tell you a story. You have probably never heard one like it in your entire life—a story of the poisonous tree on the island of Celebes. He would go on at length about the terrible effects of the fumes of this poisonous tree. Birds fell dead from the air; wild animals that roamed near the tree collapsed, and people who, out of ignorance, dared to get close to it also died. Over many years, so many corpses gathered near the tree that the resulting poisonous stench from their decomposition made it impossible for any living creature to remain on the island.

He thought of without any moral value. He probably means all her love affairs,
because when she saw a man whom she liked, he had to be at her will or else it
would have cost him his head.

To close the characterization of some of the princes of Anhalt, now we will
proceed to look at the causes which led to such a general people uprising and in many
a bloody revolution. In the year 1847 all food in Germany was very,
very expensive. A bushel of rye cost five Thalers, a price which was unattainable,
because all wages were so low and all earnings so low, as to where the mass of the
people had to go hungry, while the officials lived high on the hog. In the spring of the
same year, I had to go to work, together with several of our journeymen, at a mill for
fourteen weeks. The mill was called Amts Mill, located near the city of Zerbst.
There, we did not feel anything of the expensive times, we had plenty to eat, and
when we were finished there, we went to Jochheim, a forestry located near the Elbe
river, about three hours from Zerbst. The forester’s name was Ganzer and his ranger,
a unique individual first class, was called Fritz Otto. As good as life was at the mill,
at the forestry we lived like masters. Here is the menu: early, six o'clock, coffee,
Sugar, milk, butter and hard rolls in masses. At eight o'clock breakfast, bread, butter,
coffee, ham, meat and beer, and for master and journeymen brandy too. I, as an
apprentice, did not get any brandy. At eleven thirty was lunch. Soup, vegetables,
meat, roast, salad, bread, beer and brandy. At two o'clock, coffee, sugar, butter and
hard rolls. At four o'clock was afternoon snack. Bread, butter, wurst and such, beer
and brandy. At six thirty was dinner; again roast, bread, butter, cheese, meat, beer
and brandy and at each meal everything was available in masses. See! such was the
life of the officials. At this sight, the poor workmen had their mouths and noses wide
open. No wonder that unhappiness reigned all through the land and the question
arose. Aren't we commoners and workers human beings too, are we only here to
carry the load and pay taxes? The old forester Ganzer and his wife were the most
deserving people in the world. She, the forester’s wife, always asked us to go into
the garden and to pick for ourselves there berries, fruit and grapes as much as we
liked, there was plenty of all of these things there, so we did not have to go hungry.
The forester was a very friendly and entertaining man and each evening, when he was
not absent, all people who lived in the house and in the neighborhood gathered
outside.

Mr. Forester sat in the middle, everyone listened with attention. Then he finally
began. Now I have to tell you a story, you have probably never heard one like it in
your entire life, a story of the poisonous tree on the island Celebes and he elaborated
long and wide about the terrible consequences the fumes of this poisonous tree had.
The birds fell as corpses dead from the air; wild animals, which roamed near the
poisonous tree, collapsed dead and the people, who dared to get close to it because
of ignorance, also had to die and this way, during the course of many years, so many
corpses had gathered near the tree, so that the resulting poisonous smell due to the
decomposition of the corpses made it impossible for any living creature to live on the
island. And as long as we were there, he told this same story every evening as if it
was news and everybody listened with suspense as if they had never heard it in their
life before and exclamations of amazement and of surprise were loudly heard. After

the story was told, the congregation broke up slowly and what was the most unusual

his Mrs. Forester, the hunter, “Otten Fritze” by name, with Aunt Gertchen, our master

the servant with the chambermaid and this way also the neighbors, all left paired up.

Now, everything in the world has an end, and so our time also ended and we had to
return to the city, had to say good bye to all the nice people, the beautiful deer roasts

hunger began again for the master.

Fall of 1847 had arrived. No one, namely among the common people, had an idea
that such important political events prepared themselves, and there even were several
indications, which pointed to something very unusual. For example, in our city Zerbst,
stood since God knows when a huge sandstone sculpture which was to portrait the
Knight Roland. Helmet on his head, the sword in his fist. As | was taught, he is
supposed to be standing in seven German Cities and is supposed to mean, that
wherever such a Roland figure is standing, there is a high court, an assize in
existence. The City Council of Zerbst had decided, since the down was very rich, to
have a very artistic sentry-box built for Knight Roland and gave the order to execute
this plan to a builder named Wilhelm Raedike. He was a very rich and well to do man.
He employed many craftsmen and sculpturers, money was not held tight, only to build
a beautiful monument. As the enclosure fell, everything stood there in mighty beauty.
Everyone was amazed, was jubilant and happy about this very beautiful and expensive
building, but yet a murmur went through the crowd, as if something illegal had
happened, but no one knew what it was. Then finally it was brought to the surface.
A joker, who must have been informed in detail, had written a sarcastic poem and had
posted and distributed the same in the darkness of night, without anyone knowing

When the story had been told, the congregation broke up slowly, and what struck me as most unusual was that, in those days, everyone left in pairs. The forester with Mrs. Forester; the hunter, “Otten Fritze” by name, with Aunt Gertchen; our master with the already aging Aunt Minna; the journeyman with the cook; the servant with the chambermaid—and likewise the neighbors—everyone paired off.

Only I, the apprentice, remained seated alone with the babysitter. We exchanged our amazement about what made these couples leave together—one pair going in this direction, another in that—and all of them choosing densely overgrown spots. I suggested that we look for a spot ourselves, but without success; she wouldn’t hear of it, so we simply sat together and passed the time in cheerful conversation until it was time for bed. I really found life in the country very relaxing and sociable; we all liked one another, and the poet is certainly right when he sings: “Girl from the country, how good you truly are! How the color of virginity suits you so well!” And so on.

Now, everything in the world comes to an end, and so our time ended as well. We had to return to the city—had to say good-bye to all the nice people, to the beautiful venison roasts and carps, to the abundance and excess of everything—and the life of hunger began again for the master.

It was the fall of 1847. No one—among the common people, at least—had any idea that important political events were in preparation, though there were several signs pointing to something very unusual. For example, in our city of Zerbst there had stood, since God knows when, a huge sandstone sculpture meant to portray Knight Roland: helmet on his head, sword in his fist. As I was taught, he is said to stand in seven German cities and to signify that wherever such a Roland figure stands, there is a high court—an assize—in existence. The City Council of Zerbst had decided, since the town was very rich, to have a highly artistic sentry box built for Knight Roland, and they commissioned a builder named Wilhelm Raedike. He was a very rich and well-to-do man. He employed many craftsmen and sculptors; money was not spared, all to create a beautiful monument. When the enclosure came down, everything stood there in majestic beauty. Everyone was amazed—jubilant and delighted—at this very beautiful and expensive structure, yet a murmur went through the crowd, as if something illegal had happened, though no one knew what it was. Finally it came to light. A joker, who must have been well informed, had written a sarcastic poem and posted and distributed it in the dark of night without anyone knowing. This poem brought forth a storm of surprise and applause—but also indignation. It went like this:

Many hundreds of years you have stood there,
you gray man of stone;
you saw the waves of storm
pass you by,
and also the sunshine.
You stood untroubled,
no evil attacked you,

Notes on key fixes:
- Corrected typos and spacing (e.g., I for |, babysitter, about it).
- Smoothed awkward phrasing (“densely grown over spots” → “densely overgrown spots”; “portrait” → “portray”; “down was very rich” → “town was very rich”).
- Chose natural idioms and punctuation, tightened long sentences, and clarified “enclosure” as “scaffolding/enclosure.”
- “Sculpturers” → “sculptors”; “unsullen” → “untroubled”; “upset” → “indignation” for tone.

If you share the rest of the poem, I can continue polishing it to match this style. If you prefer British spelling (grey, autumn, good-bye → goodbye, etc.), I can adjust.",46.35207009315491,0.46484751203852326,0.5642857142857143,images/IMG_8482.jpg,True,3.1937100887298584,43.15836000442505,786.0,920.0,0.0101825

Poem
When lovers tasted,
and others threw up,
your mouth stayed shut.

The wages for such loyalty
did not tarry altogether.
The Council decided
to grant a sum of money
to build a sentry-box.

And when the building was completed—
for which much money was wasted—
the house proved too small.

“Oh my!” the master cried;
with him were clever spirits.
Be that as it may, he must go in.

Then the barbarians hacked—
my heart still bleeds to think of it—
your buttocks into pieces.
It came to nothing;
there gaped a great hole.

Be patient, you poor
and burdened knight:
time will heal all wounds.
Soon you will recover;
perhaps it will grow back again.

Prose
All efforts to find the culprit who embarrassed an honorable Council and its worthy builder were unsuccessful. The builder suffered most: wherever he showed himself, he was mocked. Even the children in the street called after him, “Ham thief! Ham thief!” But the best was yet to come; something of the sort had been in the air since the year ’48. In 1848 one of the mockers even dared to attack the reigning duke, Leopold Friedrich, in a secret lampoon and to pillory his weaknesses and sins. Spread throughout the land, the following poem appeared:

The Duke Leopold of Anhalt,
called the Tight One,
gives money to his underlings
but not to the middle class.

So not much comes, by day or night,
back from the woods,
and he stakes the welfare and luck
of the common man …

Notes on edits
- Fixed grammar and idiom (e.g., “heel” → “heal,” “other” → “others,” “did also not stay away totally” → “did not tarry altogether”).
- Smoothed phrasing while keeping the satirical tone.
- Kept the sense of a lampoon aimed at Duke Leopold Friedrich (very likely 1848, i.e., the revolutionary year).
- Preserved your line breaks; I can also rework it for rhyme or modern prose if you prefer.

If you want a more literal line-by-line cleanup, a rhymed version, or a summary in plain modern English, tell me your preference.",1546.809901714325,,,images/IMG_8483.jpg,False,2.704376697540283,1544.1055250167847,413.0,536.0,0.00587625

The effect that this explicit poem produced was tremendous. The feeling of the common people toward His Lordship, the reigning dukes, was deeply deferential; one could hardly imagine such audacity to be possible. No one dared to speak about it in public; only this much was certain: the author of such things was thought a very bad subject and a very daring human being. No one ever knew who the culprit was. How little the masses knew that events laden with consequences were approaching, I will illustrate with an example. At the beginning of March I was working with my master at a hat maker’s—the folks called him a head shoemaker—a rich, respected citizen. His name was Fritz Rost; his nickname was “Always Green,” because, despite his white hair, he still pulled off great pranks like a youngster. As noon approached, we—my master and I, the apprentice—were invited to lunch. There were other guests at the table: mill owners from the surrounding areas who had come to town on business. All were very rich, well-to-do people, whom you would think would be well informed about daily affairs and events in general. Soon the talk turned to politics and the February Revolution in France, where they wanted to establish a republic and drive away King Louis-Philippe. These were the main subjects of discussion. All agreed that the French were splendid fellows, and that such a thing would never be possible here in Germany, especially in Anhalt. Because, they said, if someone here were to speak up in public and use improper words, he would soon be grabbed by the collar and thrown into the hole (jail), and the others would rub their hands and say, “Serves him right; why can’t he keep his mouth shut?” Right now such a thing is unthinkable; the people are not yet politically mature. Rich, respected citizens spoke this way—men who had been all around the country, whom you would think would be well informed about public matters.

February Revolution in France, where they wanted to create a Republic and chase
away King Louis Philippe. These were the main subjects of the discussion. All agreed
that the French were splendid fellows and that this type of thing would never be
possible here in Germany, especially in Anhalt. Because, they said, if someone here
would speak up in public and speak with uncalled for words, soon this person would
be grabbed by the collar and stuck into the hole and the others would rub their hands
shut. Here one cannot cry out: it serves him right, why can’t he keep his mouth
shut enough. Right, against such a thing, the people are politically not yet
ripe, respected citizens spoke this way, they had been all around the

No one had the slightest inkling that the total overthrow of the existing political order was so near.

It was Saturday, 17 March. The barber—Franz Habusch was his name—came in the morning to our workplace to shave all the apprentices, as he usually did. When he was finished, he stood up and shouted, “Now, all you apprentices—and you journeymen too—fall in; I have something very important to tell you. Tonight everything will break loose!” “What?” we all cried. “You’ll see—so be ready. You journeymen will have to fight for freedom and justice; you must be prepared to sacrifice everything—even your life, if it comes to that. The time has come to topple tyranny and build a free people’s state. You apprentices must come too: smash all the windows and stand ready to help. Once again, I want your word and your handshake that you’ll do your duty. I have no more time; I still have much to do today and must prepare as many people as possible for what’s coming. Good morning again—and be there, all of you!”

We journeymen and apprentices stood there, unsure what to make of it. The day passed in hope and doubt. We ate our midday meal; nothing suspicious happened in the streets, and we thought he must have been joking. As we sat with our master at the supper table—on Saturdays we eat an hour earlier, at six—suddenly the streets erupted.

A shrill whistle that cut to the bone; running, shuffling, drumbeats so loud that the food caught in our throats. We stared at one another, horrified and astonished, then jumped up to rush outside. But our master, a cabinetmaker loyal to the government, rose and ordered us to stop. “Journeymen,” he said, “something illegal is afoot. I warn you: do not take part, but stay quietly at home. What is coming tonight can only end badly and may hold you back for the rest of your lives. Hear my warning—I speak as an experienced man and as your friend. And you apprentices, I forbid you to leave the house. Stay home and go to bed.”

It was easy for him to preach, but the noise in the street grew louder, and the journeymen, trembling with excitement, could think of nothing but throwing on their coats and hats and plunging into the tumult. We boys looked at one another, speechless. The shouts outside grew ever more enticing, and so we too ran out—come what may. We slipped between the houses, through the passageway they call the corridor, climbed over the gate, and there we were, out on the street in the midst of the chaos.

What struck us at once was that everyone was smoking, although until then a strict police ban had punished smoking in the street with a heavy fine. Everyone—

Notes on fixes:
- break lose -> break loose
- people state -> people’s state
- right -> justice (more idiomatic collocation with freedom)
- holddown -> hold you back / hinder you
- skirt -> coat (likely from German Rock)
- running, shuffle, drum beats -> running, shuffling, drumbeats
- may it cost what it will -> come what may
- Punctuation, capitalization, repetition, and OCR artifacts cleaned

was heard: Enough! Line up! Let’s go to the Duke’s residence, let’s go to the head

As soon as the order was given and the mass of people had started to move, a big
and well built man threw himself against the procession and ordered with a
commanding voice ""Stop"". Everyone stood like a building and stared at the person
giving this order, the person who would dare to stop the march from continuing.

Okay, left about! The march moved forward again, following the orders, right through
the garden of the castle. Singing, drum beating and with much noise in front of the
inain guard. The entire guard stood there pointing their guns, but neither hand nor
foot moved, no one was there to give an order. The court advisor by the name of
Pannier, was the only man in town, who in very unusual situations could give this
order in place of the Duke. It was said, that he was happy to see that the city
officials, especially the head mayor, are having quite some trouble on their hands.
Okay, the march began to move forward again, through the castle grounds, across the
old bridge, always with the call: Boys, watch out! don’t miss any windows, and we
really did our duty. At the market Square, in front of the house of a jewish bank
president by the name of Wolf, we stopped. Attack! And everything, what could be

The men pushed their way into the house, smashing everything into small pieces, until the order was heard: “Get back! Enough! We still have lots of work to do this evening.” Forwards we marched again—Casper Street—to the house of the royal forester, Sitzenstock, a most disliked man. “Back to work, boys—advance!” came the call. A hail of rocks was the answer, and the windowpanes were smashed. “Go on, march forward, men—get to work!” barked the commander.

Across the street stood the Ladder House, where ladders and firehooks were kept. Six to eight men grabbed the firehooks and rammed them into the house door. The surging crowd pushed inside, smashing everything in sight—piano, beds—destroying all, until the order was heard: “Enough! Line up! Let’s go to the Duke’s residence—to Chief Official Schultz! March forward!”

As the order was given and the crowd began to move, a big, well-built man threw himself in front of the procession and, in a commanding voice, shouted, “Stop!” Everyone froze and stared at the man who dared to halt the march. “Stop, citizens!” he called again. “I am Chief Official Schultz—the very man you intend to despoil of his property, which I earned over many years through hard work. Think about what you are doing. I admit there are many wrongs at present—such as the division of public property—but I am only the lessee and have provided for my family. If you destroy everything, my life’s work will be for nothing, and you will gain nothing by it. I have a proposal. Citizens! Choose your best man, form a circle, and let the two of us fight it out. In this way we can resolve the matter honorably.” Total silence followed his speech. The leaders conferred briefly and said, “Let him go—he spoke like a man.”

“About face!” The march resumed, following orders, straight through the castle garden. Singing, with drums beating and much noise, we came before the main guard. The entire guard stood there with their guns leveled, but neither hand nor foot moved; there was no one to give an order. The court adviser Pannier was the only man in town who, in unusual situations, could give such an order in the Duke’s stead. It was said he was happy to see the city officials, especially the lord mayor, in serious trouble.

The column moved on through the castle grounds, across the old bridge, with the constant call, “Boys, watch out—don’t miss any windows!” And we did our duty. At the market square, in front of the house of a Jewish bank president named Wolf, we halted. “Attack!” And everything that could be destroyed in a short time was destroyed. No window remained intact; all the furniture was smashed to pieces. “Advance!” came the new order. “Line up! Now to the Ham Thief!” Off to the master builder’s house, who had played such a prank on poor Roland.

main guard. The entire guard stood there pointing their guns, but neither hand nor
foot moved, no one was there to give an order. The court advisor by the name of
Pannier, was the only man in town, who in very unusual situations could give this
order in place of the Duke. It was said, that he was happy to see that the city
officials, especially the head mayor, are having quite some trouble on their hands.
Okay, the march began to move forward again, through the castle grounds, across the
old bridge, always with the call: Boys, watch out! don’t miss any windows, and we
really did our duty. At the Market Square, in front of the house of a Jewish bank
president by the name of Wolf, we stopped. Attack! And everything, what could be
destroyed in a short amount of time, was destroyed. No window remained intact in
any house, it was smashed. All furniture was smashed into pieces. Advance! the
new order sounded out. Line up! let’s go on to the Ham Thief! Okay, off to the

Now, Ludwig Habicht was close to the Duke. The most powerful person in the land
and all had to follow his orders. All the ceremonial things he did not watch. He just
wrote: | am ordering the General, the Major or Council such and such, and everyone
had to obey. The first thing he did was, that whenever he made an appearance in

Habicht: Yes, Your Highness, I can do it.
Duke: How do you want to begin? How do you intend to do this?

Narration: “Well then, you shall have unconditional power,” and, with shaking hands, he wrote out the requested authorization and signed it.

Now Ludwig Habicht was close to the Duke—the most powerful person in the land—and all had to follow his orders. He paid no attention to ceremony. He simply wrote, “I am ordering the General, the Major, or the Council such-and-such,” and everyone had to obey. The first thing he did was this: whenever he appeared in a village anywhere in the land, he ordered the entire population to a large open area and addressed them as follows:

“Citizens! I have come to advise you on the quickest way to restore law and order. If you will stand by me, I promise to buy you a house in which you can live very well. But I cannot do it alone; you must help me. Do you want to? If so, answer ‘yes’!”

And all cried out as if in a choir: “Yes! We will do this with our property and our blood!”

“Thank you,” he said, “for your promise. So let’s get to work. You must organize yourselves. Above all, you must build a citizens’ army. In each part of the city there should be one company.

And off he galloped in his carriage, amid the resounding cheers of the crowd.

They immediately organized. For each part of town they appointed a citizens’ army major—mostly fat, heavy citizens—and over the whole force a city commander. A pharmacist named Busse was elected. After the necessary guard posts were set, the leading men and their companions were designated as lieutenants, majors, and officers. Then they went to the Duke’s castle, where they received weapons, and since every citizens’ army soldier was very proud of his newfound honor, everything went very well and was soon underway. The entire town and surrounding areas were patrolled, and I would have advised anyone not to go against the citizens’ army. With all this, Minister Habicht had hit the bull’s-eye, and as if with a magic wand, the revolution there came to an end, and law and order again became the daily routine.

Notes:
- I corrected spelling, punctuation, and grammar; removed scanning artifacts; and made the dialogue coherent.
- I rendered “with a major Stick” as “with a magic wand” for natural English. If you prefer a more literal phrasing, I can adjust.

citizen, the prince with the maid or the farm girl.

See, this is the way it was in 48, life like in paradise, only too bad that it did not last
iong. The Duke was willing to fulfill all the wishes of his subordinates. Here is
another example. The duke’s next oldest brother, Prince George, lived in Florence,
italy and since he had a yearly allowance of 18,000 Thalers, the citizens of Zerbst
would say: We have here the most beautiful castle in the country, Prince George
must move here in our area and spend his money here, and immediately the Prince
and his family with eight children moved here. Since | always had to work as

friend!y old man, who walked around the whole town, ate lunch with the commoners,
eric. The oldest daughter had the title of Princess, the other children were only counts
and countesses, because the Prince in his second marriage had married a commoner,
a daughter of a musician from Dresden, who he promoted to Countess v. Erdmansdorf
through the Emperor of Austria, in order to make the marriage possible. All were very
friendly towards us workers and the greatest fun we had with the servants, who were
all /talians.

One Sunday, our precious Mother of the Land, the Duchess, had announced her visit

the surrounding villages marched to greet her on the country road. The civil army
with musical notes and the farmers all on horseback, they all awaited her at the

of thousand voices came out of each one’s throat, she stood up in the carriage and
said: | greet you all from my heart and invite you to come along with me to the rifle
range, where we will all have some fun. Another cheer and away we went, with
melodies and song, the precious Mother of the Land in our midst, off to the rifle

huge barrels. Everyone had been tapped, crowned and plenty of glasses were

Notes on fixes and uncertainties:
- Corrected obvious OCR/typos: anc’ -> and; 4a -> a; ana -> and; entre -> entire; friend!y -> friendly; a/so -> also; eric. -> etc.; /talians -> Italians; Carriage -> carriage; iong -> long.
- “civil army” adjusted to “citizens’ militia” for idiomatic English.
- “malas” taken as “maids” (likely OCR of “maids”).
- “the common soldier with the citizen” clarified as “with a citizen’s daughter” (period usage; original likely implied a female citizen).
- “musical notes” rendered as “with a band.”
- Final toast “This! … my 13 eer” appears corrupted by a page number; rendered as “This I drink to your health, my dear ones!” which fits the sense. If you have the source, I can confirm the exact wording.

all astonished and say: Please don't do this, we humans are all brothers. If there was
a gala ball, and there were many, and people of all classes attended, princes and
princesses, the highest noble ladies and gentlemen were present with their entire
families and sat in a row with the common citizen women and girls, the maids and the
farm girls. Everything appeared in the greatest harmony, and if they played music for
dancing, the journeyman danced with the princess, the common soldier with the
citizen, the prince with the maid or the farm girl.

See, this is the way it was in 48, life like in paradise, only too bad that it did not last
long. The Duke was willing to fulfill all the wishes of his subordinates. Here is
another example. The Duke’s next oldest brother, Prince George, lived in Florence,
Italy and since he had a yearly allowance of 18,000 Thalers, the citizens of Zerbst
would say: We have here the most beautiful castle in the country, Prince George
must move here in our area and spend his money here, and immediately the Prince
and his family with eight children moved here. Since I always had to work as
apprentice at the master cabinet maker's at the castle and this way we also had to
refurbish his furniture, which was scratched up from the trip, I had plenty of
opportunity to meet the Prince’s entire family. The Prince himself was a likable, very
friendly old man, who walked around the whole town, ate lunch with the commoners,
etc. The oldest daughter had the title of Princess, the other children were only counts
and countesses, because the Prince in his second marriage had married a commoner,
a daughter of a musician from Dresden, who he promoted to Countess v. Erdmansdorf
through the Emperor of Austria, in order to make the marriage possible. All were very
friendly towards us workers and the greatest fun we had with the servants, who were
all Italians.

One Sunday, our precious Mother of the Land, the Duchess, had announced her visit
to Zerbst and at two o'clock in the afternoon, the entire population of the town and
the surrounding villages marched to greet her on the country road. The civil army
with musical notes and the farmers all on horseback, they all awaited her at the
""Kruemling"" (bend), named this way because the road makes a bend there. We saw
her Carriage already from far away. As she had approached far enough and a cheer
of thousand voices came out of each one’s throat, she stood up in the carriage and
said: I greet you all from my heart and invite you to come along with me to the rifle
range, where we will all have some fun. Another cheer and away we went, with
melodies and song, the precious Mother of the Land in our midst, off to the rifle
range. Arriving there we found 39 huge barrels of beer, not the usual ""kegs"", but big
huge barrels. Everyone had been tapped, crowned and plenty of glasses were
available. First of all she was handed a full glass and then everyone present stood
around the carriage. She stood up, toasted with as many as possible and then,
swinging her glass, she shouted in a very loud voice: This I drink to your health, my

cheer again! Everyone was quite taken in by this big, pretty and proud lady. She
Gave a sign and asked everyone to be quiet, since she wanted to speak and now she
Spoke with a loud, far reaching voice: Precious children of this land! | invite you for
this evening. A gala dance is to be held in each Inn, | will take care so we have good
Music and refreshments. The city commander will tell you the details. And now, live
well my children! This evening we will see each other again. Come, come all! And
off she rode, accompanied by the sounding cheers of the crowd.

The town commander stood on the balcony of the rifle house and again invited all and
Ne also gave the names of all the Inns (restaurants) where the gala dances will be
Nneld. After all the barrels were empty to the last drop, while dancing and laughing
and singing and jumping around, the crowd broke up to get ready to gather again that
evening in the described Inns. Then they really got going and as | already indicated
earlier, all social classes were presented and in each Inn, the royal lady made an
appearance, Sat down at a table in the middle of the dance hall and watched the
dancing crowd around her. And when the right time came, she got up, took a glass
of beer, toasted with all people standing close to her and yelled with a loud voice: To
your health, my children. And then she removed herself, accompanied by the
sounding joyous noise to visit another dance hall and to make her appearance there.
There were plenty of refreshments, and when the joyous crowd left in the early
morning hours, everyone had just one wish: Oh, if it would just always be like this.

See, this is how the revolution was killed in our beautiful land of Anhalt. No one ever
thought of rebelling against the authorities, and everything again became normal,
while in other towns, i.e. in Berlin, hundreds of dead remained on the barricades and
people called to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, also called the old Lehman, as he spoke to his
citizens in the courtyard of the castle, with their heads covered: ""Fritz the Slip up ""
So, everything went along its normal way in our town. At each festivity, there was
beer and beer again, this was ordered by the citizens themselves. They elected
representatives who made liberal laws and one year later, his highness, the Duke, said
to his almighty Minister: Habicht, | don’t need you anymore, / believe! can get along

minister's wages though, which were quite high, and he was gone and forgotten.

pytesseract_gpt5,"Here’s a clean, natural-sounding edit of your passage, with the voice and period feel preserved:

“Children of this land!” A cheer from a thousand voices rang out—cheers, and cheers again! Everyone was quite taken with this stately, handsome, proud lady. She raised her hand for silence, for she wished to speak, and spoke in a loud, far‑reaching voice: “Precious children of this land! I invite you this evening. A gala dance will be held in every inn; I will see to it that there is good music and plenty of refreshments. The town commander will give you the details. And now, fare well, my children! We shall see one another again this evening. Come, come, all!” And off she rode, amid the crowd’s resounding cheers.

The town commander stood on the balcony of the rifle house and repeated the invitation; he also announced the names of all the inns where the gala dances would be held. After the barrels had been emptied to the last drop—amid dancing and laughing, singing and leaping—the crowd broke up to prepare to gather again that evening in the designated inns. Then the merrymaking truly began. As I have already said, every social class was represented, and in each inn the royal lady appeared, sat at a table in the middle of the hall, and watched the dancers whirl around her. When the right moment came, she rose, took a glass of beer, clinked glasses with those nearest her, and called out in a loud voice, “To your health, my children!” Then she took her leave, to visit another dance hall and make her appearance there, accompanied by joyous cheers. There were ample refreshments, and when the jubilant crowd went home in the early morning hours, everyone had but one wish: Oh, if only it could always be like this.

And that, you see, is how the revolution was stifled in our fair land of Anhalt. No one thought of rebelling against the authorities, and life returned to normal—while in other cities, Berlin for one, hundreds lay dead on the barricades, and people called out to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, the “old Lehman,” as he spoke to his subjects in the palace courtyard, their heads covered: “Fritz the Slip‑up!” So in our town everything went on as usual. At every festivity there was beer, and more beer—by order of the citizens themselves. They elected representatives who passed liberal laws, and a year later His Highness the Duke said to his almighty minister, “Habicht, I don’t need you anymore. I believe I can get along without you from now on.” And with that he was relieved of his office—though he kept his generous ministerial salary—and soon was gone and forgotten.

But back to myself. I was certified as a journeyman on the eighth of June; the blows and kicks that made up so much of an apprentice’s discipline had come to an end. I wanted to set out into the world, when a cousin of mine who lived in Lynnsburg arrived. His name was Redlicn, a first‑rate man of the world. He had bought a restaurant in a Prussian village called Scheinitz, near Loburg, in the province of Brandenburg. “August,” he said, “you’re coming with me—you’ll have it made there.” Well, as you know, youth is very receptive to ideas, so I went with him. I lived there about half a year. I saw again how beautiful life is in the country—so peaceful and easy; I saw how pleasant and friendly the country girls are. But all at once it was over. I thought: I cannot rot here in a village; I must go out into the wide world and seek my fortune as a workman. I went back to Zerbst, and on March 6, 1849, I set off...

Notes on key fixes and choices:
- Normalized capitalization and punctuation; removed random mid-line capitals.
- far reaching -> far‑reaching; live well -> fare well; to your health -> kept as a toast.
- were presented -> were represented; removed herself -> took her leave.
- if it would just always be like this -> if only it could always be like this.
- rifle house kept, but shooting club/Schützenhaus may be intended; say the word if you prefer that.
- knighted -> certified as a journeyman (likely from German Lossprechung/Freisprechung).
- Proper nouns: Lynnsburg and Redlicn may be Lüneburg and Redlich; confirm spellings.
- “old Lehman” and “Fritz the Slip‑up” preserved as given; if you have the German originals, I can supply a more exact idiom.

coworker Fritz Zachnit from Schlesion, and | quit our job and off we went to Dresden.
Arriving in Dresden, we stood at the bridge over the Elbe river, heard the gun fire and
noise of the granades in town, and we were undecided about what we should do.
Then, all of a sudden, there was a division of Turners from Sachsen, waving a flag
and all carrying guns. Onward! they called out to us four workemen. Two weavers
from Chemnitz had joined up with us, and we marched with them. As soon as we
arrived at the bridge, there was a Wenden army marching towards us, and as we

Tnere was no more escaping now. Of course, the Turners tried to defend themselves,
bint all was for nothing, they were trapped in a terribly narrow place. The Wenden
proceeded with pointed bajonettes, one could not even think of successfully defending
oneself. Most of the Turners, as they hung on the bridge railing, had their hands
hacked off and they fell backwards into the Elbe river. The rest was taken prisoners
and thus also us four workmen. Since we did not have any weapons and our travel
papers were in order, they brought us to the police headquarters. There, they asked
us where we were going and they transported us out of the town.

where there were still many, many armed people. Across from the Elbe bridge was
a big hotel, ""To the City Rom"", there - everything was destroyed, on the outer wall,
there wasn’t room enough to put one hand width between all the canon and grenade
hole marks. The hanging signs in the street were perforated with bullets. The fight

Notes on corrections and uncertainties:
- Goethen → Köthen (very likely; Aken–Köthen–Leipzig is a common route).
- Musspreussen → then in Prussia (often called Prussian Saxony at the time).
- Schlesion → Silesia.
- Wenden/Wends likely refers to Sorbian/Wendish troops; kept as “Wends.”
- “Prussian Regiment Alexander” kept as in the source (specific unit uncertain).
- “To the City Rom” → “Zur Stadt Rom” [To the City of Rome].
- Schanda → Schandau; Koenigstein → Königstein (Fortress/peak).
- Fixed spelling/grammar: gunfire, grenades, bayonets, workmen, filled (not riled), etc.

If you prefer, I can:
- Keep all original spellings and only correct obvious OCR errors.
- Do a smoother modern-English rewrite.
- Add brief historical/context notes (e.g., Turners, the 1849 Dresden uprising).",75.94146871566772,,,images/IMG_8492.jpg,False,3.614042043685913,72.32742667198181,883.0,1112.0,0.01222375

I worked in Sebnitz, right at the Bohemian border. From there we could take excursions every Sunday to Saxon Switzerland. I had, in any case, brought something with me from Dresden: I had bad veins in my right leg, and in the crush on the Elbe Bridge—how, I don’t know, maybe from a cannon wheel or a shove against the bridge railing—I was injured, and even after it healed, the wound broke open every year for the rest of my life, each time leaving me unable to work for four to six weeks. And just now, the wound has opened up again.

What made my stay in Sebnitz even nicer was that I met a relative from Zerbst there, maiden name Mathesius, who was married to a weaver named Wenzel. But as everything has to end someday, my time came too.

I once again tied up my knapsack and walked to Prague, where a brother of my mother had already been living for thirty years, and I had promised my mother I would visit him. Well then—good-bye, all you dear Saxons; now it’s off to Bohemia. And what horror tales they had told me about Bohemia! But none of it was true. My first overnight stay was in Schluckenau. I have never met better or nicer people. Then I went to Rumburg, Tábor, Böhmisch Leipa. When I arrived there, something very unusual happened to me. As soon as I entered the inn, the innkeeper came toward me, embraced me, hugged and kissed me, and said, “Welcome, my son! I have waited for you so long. You are my son!” “Father!” she called out to her husband, “see here—now we have gotten a son.” I stood there speechless; I did not know what to say. She, however, pulled me down onto a chair beside her and said, “You’ll stay here with me; you’ll be my son. I’ll get you work, and in the evenings and on Sundays you’ll be with us; and if you don’t want to work at your trade anymore, you’ll help us. We have no children, and when we die someday, it will all belong to you.” I was speechless at such kindness. I got plenty to eat and drink, and at night I had a nice bed.

The next morning, when the same affection began all over again, I pulled myself together and said, “Mother, when I was still in school my mother always told me: ‘Boy, when you go far away someday, you must first visit my brother in Prague.’ See, Mother,” I said to her, “I promised her that, and I have to keep that promise. I have to go to Prague, and then I’ll come back to you.” “Yes,” she said, “I know all that already. Once you are in Prague, you’ll never come back to us. Since you have promised your mother, then go on—but you won’t take your knapsack. I’ll send it to you there. Here is the address where you can pick it up.”

Said and done. I left for Prague. In Prague I went to the carpenters’ inn, located at the Borsitz—a huge, mighty inn where hundreds of men and women sat drinking beer. As soon as I sat down, a waitress came toward me with a mug of beer, embraced me, hugged and kissed me, and said, “You are my bridegroom.” I was utterly astonished and thought, Are they all crazy here in Bohemia? I drank my beer and thought about where I could find my cousin. When I saw that an old man sat next to me, I asked him if he knew the firm Boulange & Burdan. He replied that he did, and when I asked if he knew the foreman there—my cousin—he said yes and that he would take me there. Said and done. We got up, and he led me a short way before we reached the Moldau Bridge. “Here,” he said, “go straight through, then cross the courtyard, go into the workshop, and there you’ll find your—”

work in Sebnitz, right at the Boehmen border. From there, we could take excursions
each Sunday to Sachsen Switzerland. I had gotten something anyway from Dresden;
I had bad veins on my right leg and in the shuffle on the Elbe bridge, I don't know
how, maybe from a cannon wheel or a push against the bridge railing, I was injured,
and this injury, even after healing, broke open each year all the rest of my life, and
each time rendered me unable to work for four to six weeks, and just now, the wound
has opened up again.


What made my stay in Sebnitz even nicer was that I met a relative from Zerbst there,
of the maiden name Mathesius, who was married there to a weaver named Wenzel.
Now then, as everything has to end some day, my time came too!

I once again tied up my knapsack and walked to Prag, where a brother of my mother
lived already for thirty years, and I had promised my mother I would visit him. Well
then, good bye, all you dear Sachseners, now it’s off to Boehmen. And what horror
tales they have told me about Boehmen. But nothing was true. My first stay
overnight was in Schlukenau. I have never met better and nicer people. Then I went
to Rumburg, Tabor, Boehmisch Leipa. When I arrived there, something very unusual
happened to me. As soon as I had entered the Inn, the innkeeper came towards me,
embraced me, hugged and kissed me and said welcome, my son! I have waited for
you so long. You are my son! Father! she called out to her husband, see here, now
we have gotten a son. I stood there speechless, I did not know what to say. She,
however, pulled me down on a chair beside her and said: You stay here with me,
you'll be my son, I'll get you work and evenings and Sundays you'll be with us, and
if you don’t want to work at your job anymore, you'll help us, we have no children and
when we die some day, it will all belong to you. I was speechless over all this
kindness. I got plenty of food and drink and at night I had a nice bed. The next
morning, when the same love began all over again, I got myself together and said.
Mother, when I was still in school my mother always told me: Boy, when you go far
away some day, then you'll first visit my brother in Prag. See, mother, I said to her,
and I promised her that and I have to keep that promise, I have to go to Prag and then
I'll come back to you. Yes, she said, I know all that already, once you are in Prag,
you'll never come back to us, since you have already promised your mother, then go
on, but you'll not take your knapsack, I'll send it to you there. Here, she said, is the
address where you can pick it up.

Said, done. I left for Prag. At Prag I went to the carpenters’ Inn, located at the
Borsitz. A huge, mighty Inn, where hundreds of men and women sat and drank beer.
As soon as I sat down, a waitress came towards me with a mug of beer, she
embraced me, hugged and kissed me and said: You are my bridegroom. I was
totally astonished, and thought: Is everyone crazy here in Boehmen? I drank my beer
and thought about where I could find my cousin. When I saw that an old man sat
next to me, I asked him if he knew the company Boulange & Burdan. He replied that
he knows them, and when I asked him if he knew the foreman there, who is my
cousin, he said yes and he would take me there. Said, done. We got up, he took me
there, a short piece before we got to the Moldau bridge. Here, he said, go straight

- inn (tavern) lowercased; Inn (river) would be capitalized if meant, but here it’s clearly a tavern.
- Replaced OCR glitches: I for /, cleaned stray characters, normalized quotes and punctuation.
- “Doys” is unclear; I assumed “boys.” If it was meant to be “You Germans,” I can adjust to that.
- Left “the Platten” as given; if you want the likely modern name (e.g., Plattenjoch), I can confirm.

Germans IS SO strong there now that they would kill you. Go through the Pusterthal

pass to Ampezzo. From there to Treviso, Belluno, Conegliano to Triest at the Adriatic

The area is a paradise; only, it’s not for poor young workmen. If it had not been for the Jews and the Catholic priests, we would have starved. We often ran into soldiers who were returning from the Hungarian campaign. I have never seen a picture of greater sorrow and suffering. All were barefoot; the officers wore women’s skirts, their swords dangled from a string—that’s how they walked quietly along. The Austrian government was embarrassed to let these soldiers walk into the military post like this; therefore, they housed them in villages near the Adriatic Sea until they had new uniforms and had fattened up a bit. So we finally arrived at Triest on Saturday after having experienced some hair-raising things—starving, ragged, looking like bums. 

The innkeeper where we turned in—the inn was called “The German Knight”—showed no mercy. He said, “So much trash comes here; look for work, and then I’ll keep you.” “Okay, let’s look for work.” He sent us to a master named Koselik (named after the old railroad crossing barricades). There, hundreds of workers were employed, mainly in shipbuilding. As we arrived, the foreman, a German, said to us, “We need many workers, but the German workers have all been let go because they did not want to work until eight o’clock anymore. I cannot employ any Germans until the owner gives permission, and he won’t be back until Monday.” So that was it for us for now. 

Hungry and freezing, we returned to town, tried to beg for a piece of bread, but without success. We told the German Knight about our mishap. He said, “Have you already been to the Sachsen?” We said no. Then he described to us once more where they lived, on Laibacher Main Street. It was already getting dark, but our needs pushed us to go on. Then, finally, we found them: a big, grand, imposing house of the firm “Laboratorio di Faleynamie e Billardi e Eschebach e Ehrenberg.” We rushed upstairs to the office. “Two out-of-town carpenters are asking for work,” we said. “We have work,” answered the man in the room. “Where do you come from?” he asked. My travel companion answered, “From Graz, Steiermark.” “And you?” he asked me. I said, “I am a Prussian.” “Where in Prussia?” he kept asking. I answered, “I’m really not a Prussian.” “Where are you from, then?” he continued. “From Anhalt,” I said. “So, from Anhalt,” he said. “Where in Anhalt?” “From Dessau,” I said. “From Dessau!” he cried, surprised. “That makes you a fellow countryman of my companion.” He tore the door open and yelled, “Ehrenberg! Ehrenberg! Come in here,” and continued, “I am introducing you to a fellow countryman here.” 

General surprise, then happy handshakes, and the agreement that we would have work on Monday. “Well, this is all very nice and good, but the German Knight does not want to keep us without money.” They said, “Go to the police, leave your travel books there, and bring us a Charta di Permanenza; then we will give each of you an advance of one gulden.” We went and got it quickly, and we each received one gulden as an advance and, feeling rich, we marched over to the German Knight.

Located on the beautiful Blue Danube, I stayed there another four weeks and worked in the shop of a harmonica maker. From there I went on to Prague, stayed with my cousins, visited old acquaintances, and then went via Dresden, Leipzig, and Halle to Zerbst. Late in the evening I arrived at my father’s, mother’s, and sister’s, and—as expected—was welcomed with open arms. And the next morning, early at five o’clock, I already had to leave for my draft appointment in Dessau. My lottery number was No. 13. During my physical examination I was declared unfit for military service. “Anton is exempt due to bad veins,” the verdict read. So I was free again, able to travel once more into the faraway world.

I first worked a few months in Dessau, where I met a regional representative whom the government had given the choice either to be investigated and punished or to emigrate. Since he had already been in Texas, in New Braunfels, in his youth, he decided to move there with his family—wife, son, and daughter. Being wealthy, he wanted to establish a colony, and for this he wanted to take with him an architect named Freisleben from Dessau, a toolsmith named Herrmann from Chemnitz, Saxony, a gardener, Simon Schmiedt, from Dessau, and little old me. We traveled through Magdeburg, Braunschweig, Hanover, and Bremen. In Bremen I happened by chance to meet a fellow countryman named Leopold von Hammer, a very kind person. He had been an Austrian hussar lieutenant and had to resign his commission because of too many debts. He lived two years in Copenhagen and had already been in Bremen for six months, supported by the Bishop of Muenster. He told me, “Fellow countryman, don’t go to Texas. I want to make you a proposal: I have a cousin in Mexico, a very wealthy man. He served a long time in government there, obtained 6,000 acres from the government, and wants to start a German settlement on it. We will land for nothing, with money given to us at the beginning, and you will go there with me.” Said and done—his persuasion worked, and I went with him toward Texas. However, the plan came to nothing; the gentleman borrowed money from us, cheated us out of our clothes, and one fine day he vanished. We sent our bill to the Bishop of Muenster, and he made good on it.

Now I was working in Bremen. I came and went, as a decent journeyman, in and out of the Herberge in der Tiefer, whose innkeeper was Father Roesemann. What I saw the journeymen do there really made me sick. Playing cards, drinking beer—that was all. I thought: this has to change. I gathered several friends and reminded them that we had gone out into the wide world to learn something. At the next official meeting, after the regular business had been taken care of, I stood up and addressed the attendees as follows: We all went out into the world to learn something, to educate ourselves in practice and in theory, so that when we return home we can become good masters and decent citizens. A carpenter has to be able to draw, write, do arithmetic, and keep books. I therefore propose a continuing-education club, and let’s do it here in this inn: here we are at home, and here no one can forbid us anything. Said and done—everyone agreed. An evening for the first meeting was set. The club, given the harmless name “The Evening Entertainment,” was founded; a teacher was hired, statutes were drawn up, and officers elected—myself, of course, as president. The lesson plan was as follows: Sunday, from 7 a.m. until 1 p.m., drawing; Monday …

Notes on edits and assumptions:
- Standardized place names: Prague, Copenhagen; kept Muenster as in your text. I assumed “Dessay” meant “Dessau.”
- Replaced OCR artifacts (/, |, odd spacing) and corrected punctuation, capitalization, and agreement (journeymen, lesson plan).
- Clarified “The Bishop from Muenster stopped him” to “supported by the Bishop of Muenster,” which fits the context.

mathematics; Wednesday off; Thursday evening, from 8 PM until 1 PM, German and
Friday evening, from 8 PM until 10 PM Geometry; Saturday off. And this all went
along really well. All journeymen showed up eager to learn. Every four weeks, there
was an evening for debate. The best teachers came and gave us lessons.

In the spring of 1852, | again got sand in my shoes and decided to travel together
with three others, a tailor, a shoemaker and a carpenter, to Amsterdam. We
celebrated our leaving, everyone promised by handshake to keep our project going and
to keep the continuing education club running. A large number of people
accompanied us to the outskirts of Bremen, for hours walking on a country road, we
sang another song and then said good bye. We were again wanderers. By way of
a part of Oldenburg and Hannover we arrived on Dutch territory and got aboard ship
in Harderwick near the Zuidersee. After a very story and dangerous trip we arrived
one evening in Amsterdam. In front of us were three brightly lit streets, | said: We'll
take the middle one, and after we had walked down the middle street quite a piece,
sorne one Called to us from a wine cellar: Germans! Come in here! lama young
man from Bremen, a good German, here you'll be treated well. We looked at each
other and in we went.

We had nothing to be sorry for there. We were treated very well there. The next day
we went to look for work and also found it. Well, to describe Amsterdam would fill
more than a book; here are just a few things. The town is built right in the middle
of water, all houses are on poles; the city hall is build on 60,000 poles. All streets
nave canals, through which the ships glide with full sails. There are only two solid
places in town, the Butter Market Place and the Place of the Mayor's house. Six
hunared bridges took care of traffic flow. And the population, one can hardly say, if
there is a pack of people who are more possessed by hate for the Germans.
Whenever we entered a public restaurant, sat down to get something to eat, everyone
moved far away from us. - Muff! Muff! they called us, that is the rude name for the
Germans. When we had a glass of wine which, by the way, was very small, they all
yelled: ""Can these guys drink"" and they too themselves drank schnapps by the quart.
One half of the population lived in huge palaces covered with silk, jewels, and money,
and the largest part of the population was poor, So poor, which we Germans could not
even begin to understand. There were places to sleep which consisted of a tightly
stretched tope over which the poor were hanging, sleeping. - With a wheel barrow
equipped with some type of rack, on top of that an iron plate and a few pots and
pans, they went from place to place and kept up this moving pitiful restaurant going,
below the heads of little children were peaking out and at night they would Stop at
a place protected from rain and storm. Many people there live this way. Drinking
schnapps, give in to their worse passions, complain about anything German, you Séé,
this is what we found in Amsterdam. No wonder, that it filled us with disgust and
sstonishment and so we left again after experiencing quite a few unpleasant things.
Suil in Utrecht, not far form the German border, they ran after us, Muff! Mufti they
called us. As we arrived at the Inn to spend the night, everyone stared at us and the
women screamed: Oh, the poor German boys, they want to get around in the world,
and at home they have nothing to eat. Our boys have it made compared to them,

We had nothing to be sorry for there. We were treated very well there. The next day
we went to look for work and also found it. Well, to describe Amsterdam would fill
more than a book; here are just a few things. The town is built right in the middle
of water, all houses are on poles; the city hall is built on 60,000 poles. All streets
have canals, through which the ships glide with full sails. There are only two solid
places in town, the Butter Market Place and the Place of the Mayor's house. Six
hundred bridges took care of traffic flow. And the population, one can hardly say, if
there is a pack of people who are more possessed by hate for the Germans.
Whenever we entered a public restaurant, sat down to get something to eat, everyone
moved far away from us. - Muff! Muff! they called us, that is the rude name for the
Germans. When we had a glass of wine which, by the way, was very small, they all
yelled: ""Can these guys drink"" and they too themselves drank schnapps by the quart.
One half of the population lived in huge palaces covered with silk, jewels, and money,
and the largest part of the population was poor, so poor, which we Germans could not
even begin to understand. There were places to sleep which consisted of a tightly
stretched rope over which the poor were hanging, sleeping. - With a wheel barrow
equipped with some type of rack, on top of that an iron plate and a few pots and
pans, they went from place to place and kept up this moving pitiful restaurant going,
below the heads of little children were peeking out and at night they would stop at
a place protected from rain and storm. Many people there live this way. Drinking
schnapps, give in to their worse passions, complain about anything German, you see,
this is what we found in Amsterdam. No wonder, that it filled us with disgust and
astonishment and so we left again after experiencing quite a few unpleasant things.
Still in Utrecht, not far from the German border, they ran after us, Muff! Muff! they
called us. As we arrived at the Inn to spend the night, everyone stared at us and the
women screamed: Oh, the poor German boys, they want to get around in the world,
and at home they have nothing to eat. Our boys have it made compared to them,

the courtyard of the Dome, it was filled with people. They formed a path and as we
marched through, they all yelled an enthusiastic hurray! Live well, live well! they
screamed, you ‘Il come back again to Bremen. We were led across the bridge and then
a piece further, then our escorts stopped and said: Now, we think you are brave
guys, you'll find the way across the border by yourself and won't cause us any
problems and come back to Bremen. We said, we would not even think of it. Well
then, give us your hand and have a good trip. Good bye! Promise. After we had
walked a short distance, there was a sign which let you know that beer was sold
there. We went in and exchanged our feelings over a glass of beer. Herman, | said,
/ am going back to Bremen again, | have to see Marie again and since we were of
opposite opinions about going back to Bremen, we said good bye to each other. /
went into a workshop where they made chairs while | was in the newer part of town.
Everybody there was astonished, they formed a circle around me and asked me what
they could do for me. | said: Give me some money and different clothes, because
/ want to go into Bremen one more time, so that the police won't recognize me. In
no time | had everything, a hand shake and forwards | went across the bridge to the
Inn again. Father Roesemann was astonished, hurry, he said, come into my private
room. | sat there until it got dark, then / went to see her, we said good bye, looked
in each other's eyes once more and then it was time to say good bye here too. The
next morning, early at five o'clock, / left in the company of a friend, Heinrich Deyen

As we crossed the courtyard of the cathedral, it was filled with people. They formed a path and, as we marched through, they all yelled an enthusiastic hurrah! “Live well, live well!” they screamed. “You’ll come back to Bremen again.”

We were led across the bridge and then a little farther. Then our escorts stopped and said: “Now, we think you are brave guys; you’ll find the way across the border by yourselves and won’t cause us any problems by coming back to Bremen.” We said we would not even think of it. “Well then, give us your hand and have a good trip. Goodbye! Promise.”

After we had walked a short distance, there was a sign that beer was sold there. We went in and shared our feelings over a glass of beer. “Hermann,” I said, “I am going back to Bremen; I have to see Marie again.” And since we were of opposite opinions about going back to Bremen, we said goodbye to each other.

I went into a workshop where they made chairs, in the newer part of town. Everyone there was astonished; they formed a circle around me and asked what they could do for me. I said: “Give me some money and different clothes, because I want to go into Bremen one more time, so that the police won’t recognize me.” In no time I had everything; a handshake, and off I went across the bridge to the inn again.

Father Roesemann was astonished. “Hurry,” he said, “come into my private room.” I sat there until it got dark, then I went to see her. We said goodbye, looked into each other’s eyes once more, and then it was time to say goodbye here too.

The next morning, early at five o’clock, I left, in the company of a friend, Heinrich Deyen from Melle. From Bremen we marched 17 more hours to Nienberg on the Weser River. The next morning we said goodbye to each other; he went to Melle and I went via Hannover, Braunschweig, and Magdeburg to Zerbst. My parents were amazed that I showed up all of a sudden.

The next morning I showed up at the police station. Everyone shouted, “Welcome, Mister President!” They took away my passport for exile and informed me that I would remain under police supervision for one year and that I could not leave town. A short time later I became very ill for several months, and I have to thank my now-deceased mother for her care for me; otherwise I could have died.

Later, I worked again for a local master, met stage stars, and acted as a comedian because I was bored. When I had had enough of that, after I had helped to bury my dear father in 1854, I went, in the year 1855, to Berlin, worked there another three years, and had to admit to myself that I had been a real jackass for not having come to Berlin earlier. There you always worked in the same workplace and therefore you became very skilled in the trade and earned a lot of money.

My thoughts were now directed to becoming a master in Zerbst, and so I went to draw. Each time I had saved 100 thalers; when the money was gone, I began to work—

Since there was a need for a tourism office in town, I set one up. We had everything we wanted and earned plenty of money. I was allowed to sell schnapps, beer, wine, tobacco, and cigars in or out of my house. To put up the many guests who were always there, we opened a restaurant, and I had to pay only eight thalers for a license each year.

I had grown nearly twice my former size as the inn’s host, and she didn’t like, all of a sudden, living under such wealthy circumstances. “August,” she said to me one fine day, “we will go to America. There we will really make some money.” I tried to talk her out of it, but in vain. What could I do? I had to go with her, and since she had always been a very agreeable woman toward me, I gave in.

So I stood there, nearly out of my mind, with my seven children. What good would it do to lament—she would not come back to life—so I had to pull myself together and take care of the children. I bought three acres of land near town, built a beautiful house on it, started a garden planted with fruit trees and grapevines, and planted vegetables. The children were able to sell it all very easily, and we were well off again. The social life there was the very best. We had a flourishing German sports club; the sportsmen from neighboring towns visited us, and we visited them—it was a truly German life.

Father Cullman met us at the train station and found us a place to spend the night. The next day I was given a house to use, free of charge. We both worked at Dreher’s Furniture Factory, and when that work ran out, we soon found work here and there. Then one day, while I was working at Richter’s Hotel, I got hold of a newspaper advertisement from Tuscumbia—an ad that was very tempting for Germans. I went there, and a certain Roth took me out to Spring Valley, about seven miles from Tuscumbia, to a certain Captain Raether. He had for rent a 600‑acre farm on which there was also a flour mill. This was a very tempting opportunity for the right man. The house was like a castle, with a huge park around it; around the park lay hundreds of acres of the most fertile land; there was an enormous herd of cattle, four horses, twelve cows, 600 sheep, hundreds of pigs and chickens, and countless ducks and geese. Also a 36‑acre fruit garden. All this for 500 dollars a year. Thirty acres had been divided into lots—those alone would cover the rent. I said, “Captain, I am a craftsman; I cannot handle all this.

Notes:
- I assumed “Drehers” and “Richters” were possessive (Dreher’s Furniture Factory; Richter’s Hotel).
- “Thirty acres were divided into lots” was interpreted as already subdivided.
- The phrase “I had gotten nearly twice the size as father of the Inn” is ambiguous in the source. I rendered it as physical growth/weight from prosperity (“twice my former size as the inn’s host”). If you intended “twice as prosperous as the inn’s owner,” I can adjust.

uncountable ducks and geese. Also a 36 acre fruit garden. All this for the price of
500 dollars a year. Thirty acres were divided into lots, these alone would bring in the
rent. I said: Captain, I am a craftsman, I cannot handle all this, but I know a man in
Cullman, he has money and is a German farmer, I will get him and then we will rent
this farm. Said, done. I returned to Cullman that same evening. My son August

Questions/unclear items to confirm
- Opening fragment before “about the farm…” is garbled. Do you have the preceding sentence?
- Is the town Tuscumbia in both places where I supplied it?
- Names/spellings: Raether, Roth, Challen, Bressler, Levy, Frank P. O’Brien, John Wiesendanger, August Grueninger, Colonel Linn, Mrs. Watson.
- “the three workers” replaces “the 3 ¢-” in the original; can you clarify what was intended?
- “worked like [unclear]”: the source word is illegible—can you supply it?
- “holy night before Easter” = Holy Saturday—keep as is?
- “I worked for him year and day” was smoothed to “a long time.” Do you prefer the original phrasing?

pytesseract_gpt5,"It looks like you’ve pasted an OCR’d passage from a memoir/letter—there are many scanning errors. I can clean this up. Would you prefer:
- a faithful transcription (fixing only obvious typos), or
- a smooth, edited rewrite in clear English, or
- a short summary?

Quick summary of the clear parts:
- The writer worked as a cabinetmaker in Birmingham, dealing with changing landlords and rising rents on 20th Street (near what became Reynolds Lumber Yard). He was offered purchase terms but chose to rent; the property later resold several times at much higher prices.
- In 1889 a company promised him a house, machinery, lumber, and capital if he would run a larger operation; the machinery was good, but the lumber was unusable and promised cash rarely arrived.
- Payroll delays caused trouble; his son August (a skilled foreman) left for Memphis.
- A new “Southern Wood Working Company” formed, requiring each worker to invest $200; it later went bankrupt.
- He then partnered with an Italian named Snetti, built a shop at 407 20th Street, regained independence, and did well. Snetti left and soon died. The writer’s sons Emil and Fritz eventually took over the shop.
- Social life: In 1881 local Germans organized a major South Side festival (theater, dance hall, playground, fireworks) at the site later known as Reynolds Lumber Yard. After a successful event, they founded a Protestant church; Pastor Thuemen (whom the writer knew from Tuscumbia) served first.

Sample cleaned rewrite (from a clearer section):
“We had plenty of work. My son August was an excellent foreman, and we employed twenty to thirty people. But when Saturday came and the men didn’t get paid, there was trouble. The money was owed to us, but you can’t collect it so easily. August grew angry and said he would rather earn wages as a foreman; he went to Memphis, and that ended the situation. The Southern Wood Working Company was then organized from the ruins, with each coworker expected to invest $200 of his own capital. That company later went bankrupt as well. I then partnered with an Italian named Snetti. We built our own shop at 407 20th Street and felt independent again; everything went well. Later my partner left, started his own business, and soon after died. Then my sons Emil and Fritz said, ‘Father, give us the shop. You’re already old and shouldn’t have to work so hard. Stay with us.’ And it has remained that way to this day.”

Questions to resolve the garbled parts at the start:
- Is “Elyton Land Company” the correct name of the owner of the lot?
- Were you offered to buy for $1,200 with $25 down, $5 per month, at 8% interest—or were the monthly terms $10?
- Do the resale figures read $5,000, then $10,000, then $27,000?
- Is the address “20th Street South” correct for the early shop, and later “407 20th Street”?

If you confirm those details (or share a clearer image), I’ll produce a clean, fully edited version of the entire passage.",90.64849472045898,,,images/IMG_8506.jpg,False,3.1604957580566406,87.48799896240234,894.0,736.0,0.0084775

a sports hall near where the brewery is today. When the cashier later took off with
18 dollars, the thing got a push. For a while, everyone was sleeping until we got
together later one evening at August Dunker’s who rana store on 14th Street in those
days, and we Started again to found a sports club. Friend Weidemann became the
coach. The first sports hall was located on the South Side. Then in the place of the
German Association ""Sublet Hall"", and then we moved to First Avenue. There we did
sports and held festivities until the end came there too. Unpleasant events appeared
to make it plausible that the club suspend its activities. Such a decision was made

The next thing was to start a sports club. A 73-year-old tailor named Landgraf served as sports instructor. Oh, those were the days. Someone provided us with a sports hall near where the brewery stands today. When the cashier later took off with 18 dollars, the whole thing took a hit. For a while everything lay dormant, until one evening we got together at August Dunker’s—he ran a store on 14th Street in those days—and set about founding a sports club again. Our friend Weidemann became the coach. The first sports hall was on the South Side, then at the German Association’s “Sublet Hall,” and later we moved to First Avenue. There we did sports and held festivities until that, too, came to an end. Unpleasant events made it advisable for the club to suspend its activities. The Board made that decision, and the gear and equipment were stored at the Schillinger Brewery until, after two years, a reorganization finally took place.

The next thing was to start a sports club. An already 73-year old tailor named
Landgraf was a sports teacher. Oh, that was a life. Someone had provided us with
a sports hall near where the brewery is today. When the cashier later took off with
18 dollars, the thing got a push. For a while, everyone was sleeping until we got
together later one evening at August Dunker’s who ran a store on 14th Street in those
days, and we started again to found a sports club. Friend Weidemann became the
coach. The first sports hall was located on the South Side. Then in the place of the
German Association ""Sublet Hall"", and then we moved to First Avenue. There we did
sports and held festivities until the end came there too. Unpleasant events appeared
to make it plausible that the club suspend its activities. Such a decision was made
by the Board and the utensils and all equipment were stored in the Brewery Schillinger
until after two years a reorganization finally occurred. So now, there was just a
blossoming German Club here, the German Association, a club full of life and activity.

Several members quit this Club in ‘86 and founded a second German Club, they said
Concordia should be its name. Then the Sports Club began to come alive again under
President Emil Lesser. Germans relaxed there; sang, happiness and German traditions
were practiced. And it is this way to this day. May God, being good willed towards
the Germans, keep these two German Clubs for a long time here in Birmingham, so
that both can blossom and grow and give witness to that wherever the Germans
might live, German song and German traditions will be practiced by them. I have the
honor to be a member in both clubs since many years, even as an Honorable Member
in one of them.

Well, even though I have spent many long years in beautiful Birmingham, I have not

been able to acquire money and property, but the love of my children and the respect

of many of my dear friends and countrymen remained, friends from whom I had often

gotten quite real proof of their love through actual help and devotion through bad

fires and illness. My most sincere wish is that it may remain this way until the end
of my life. Well then, I probably could write about a lot more, but everything has to

come to an end one day and so I have only one wish that these, my written down
memories of my life, would please My German friends and countrymen. Thanks are
also due to the German Religious Societies, they stand for discipline, education and
humanity, the most important factors in the life of people and I only wish that my
health will allow me to spend time in their midst quite often, though I can hardly ever
go there, I am always among them in spirit, being the good Christian I am.

An elderly man—now seventy—who was credited with helping to establish the Germania here, is offering a booklet for the modest price of fifty cents. It is well worth the price and provides lively, suspenseful, and colorful scenes from people’s lives. It will not bore the reader and should therefore be found in every German household in Birmingham. In the interest of this seventy-year-old gentleman, I express the wish of many of his friends that our fellow citizens please help him by purchasing a copy, to brighten the last days of the writer’s life.

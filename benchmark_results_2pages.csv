Notes
- Use “Memoirs” (not “Memories”) for the standard book genre.
- “At his friends’ urging/prompting” is the idiomatic way to say “as a result of the motivation of his friends.”
- “Published by the author” or “self-published” is more natural than “published by the writer.”
- Consider removing the stray closing quote after Reflections or add an opening quote for symmetry.

If you tell me whether “Eagle” is a pseudonym, a publisher’s device, or a place, I can format that line appropriately.",25.49313521385193,6.7299270072992705,6.375,images/IMG_8478.jpg,True,,2.9136803150177,22.57945489883423,34.0,264.0,0.0026825

he then often received quite sensible memories from his father or his mother.

was run by an old Kantor widow named ""Durre"" and was assisted by her already
pretty mature daughter “Auguste”. Later, when the City Council of Zerbst had a huge

To my friends and countrymen!

Urged on many sides to set down the memories of my life and of the events of the year ’48, insofar as they touched me personally, and to publish these recollections, I will herewith fulfill my friends’ wish and only ask your kind indulgence if my descriptions are not elegant. I shall do the best I can.

Once upon a time, many, many years ago, in the old city of Zerbst, in the beautiful land of Anhalt in the German homeland, a sturdy boy was born to an honest master craftsman and his wife. This boy was later baptized in the Reformed Church and received the name August. Now, I cannot honestly remember all the details; only this much was clear to me: that I must be August. The boy grew; he liked his food and drink, and when, in his youthful ways, he played some foolish pranks, he often received quite sensible reminders from his father or his mother.

At six years of age I was sent to a so‑called Winkelschule (“corner school”), which was run by an old cantor’s widow named Dürre and assisted by her already quite grown daughter, Auguste. Later, when the City Council of Zerbst had a large, stately building erected and designated it as a public school, all school‑aged children from five to fourteen were required to attend it, and the Winkelschule ceased operating. At the examination I received a report card: “Accepted into first grade on a trial basis!” I went there for the next five years, and in the last two I was the top student.

In 1844 I was confirmed, and now it was time to choose a lifelong trade. I would have loved to become a fur tanner; however, I was unable to find a master to teach me. In 1842 I had begun an apprenticeship with my mother’s brother, who was a master fur tanner, and I worked at his place during my free time when I did not have school. I had to be confirmed first; before I could be, he died, and since I could not find another master, though I tried very hard, I began my apprenticeship with Franz Wiegand, the best cabinetmaker around. The apprenticeship lasted four years. On 8 June 1848, after passing my examination, I was declared a journeyman carpenter, and the presiding court assessor took my oath and handshake and enjoined me to travel to foreign parts, to see other cities and countries, so that, when the time came, I might become a capable master of the trade and a good citizen. That I honestly did; before I tell of it, though, I would first like to speak a bit about the beautiful land of Anhalt and then about the events of the year ’48.

Now, during the fine pre‑March period, the reigning princes of our German fatherland were the Alpha and Omega, the sun around which everything turned, and I would like to be permitted to describe some of our former rulers. Albrecht the Bear, a mighty warrior before God, was the founder of the dynasty. I suppose there would be little interest if I were to recite the entire family tree. We’ll talk a little about the Old Dessauer, the Old Mustache, who was a successful general under two emperors and two kings. He played a foolish prank in the eyes of his—

Notes and small choices:
- I rendered “carpenter officer” as “journeyman carpenter,” the standard term for someone who has completed an apprenticeship.
- “Winkelschule” is kept with a brief gloss; it was an informal private “dame school.”
- The original has “mistress” for the mother; I’ve used “his wife” to avoid the modern connotation and reflect the likely sense “Meisterin” (master’s wife).
- If you prefer a more literal or a more modernized style, I can adjust. If you share the next portion, I can continue in the same voice.",69.90433120727539,0.3891277641277641,0.4639344262295082,images/IMG_8479.jpg,True,,3.823345184326172,66.08098602294922,815.0,944.0,0.010458750000000001

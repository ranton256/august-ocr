Once upon a time, many, many years ago, in the old city of Zerbst, in the beautiful

Ne loved to taste and when he, because of his young ways, did some dumb pranks,
he then often received quite sensible memories from his father or his mother.

With my sixth year, | was sent to a so-called ""Winkel School” (Corner school) which
was run by an old Kantor widow named ""Durre"" and was assisted by her already
pretty mature daughter “Auguste”. Later, when the City Council of Zerbst had a huge

To my friends and countrymen!

Urged from many sides to write down the memories of my life, as well as the events of the year ’48, insofar as they touched me personally, and to publish these recollections, I will hereby fulfill my friends’ wish. I ask only for your kind indulgence if my descriptions are not elegant. Well then, I will do the best I can.

Once upon a time, many, many years ago, in the old city of Zerbst, in the beautiful land of Anhalt in Germany, a sturdy boy was born to an honest draper and his wife. This boy was later baptized in the Reformed church and given the name August. Now, I cannot honestly remember all the details; only this much was clear to me—that I must be August. The boy grew up; he loved his food and drink, and when, in his youthful ways, he got up to some silly pranks, he often received quite sensible reminders from his father or his mother.

When I was six, I was sent to a so‑called “Winkel school” (a small private “corner school”) run by an old cantor’s widow named Dürre and assisted by her already rather grown daughter, Auguste. Later, when the city council of Zerbst had a large, stately building erected and designated it as a public school, all school-age children from five to fourteen were required to attend it, and the Winkel school ceased operation. At the entrance examination, I received a report card: admitted to the first class on a trial basis. I attended for the next five years, and in the last two I was the top student.

In 1844 I was confirmed, and now it was time to choose a profession for life. I would have loved to become a fur tanner, but I could not find a master to teach me. In 1842 I had begun an apprenticeship with my mother’s brother, who was a master fur tanner, and I worked at his place in my spare time when I was not in school. But before I could be confirmed, he died, and since I could not find another master, although I tried very hard, I began my apprenticeship with Franz Wiegand, the best cabinetmaker around. The apprenticeship lasted four years. On 8 June 1848, after passing my examination, I was declared a journeyman carpenter, and the court assessor in office took my word and my handshake and charged me to travel to foreign parts, to see other cities and countries, so that, when the time came, I could become a capable master of the trade and a good citizen. That I have honestly done. Before I tell of it, though, I would first like to speak a bit about the beautiful land of Anhalt and then about the events of the year ’48.

Now, during the beautiful pre‑March (Vormärz) time, the reigning princes of our German fatherland were the alpha and omega—the sun around which everything revolved. Permit me to describe some of our former rulers. “Albrecht the Bear,” a mighty warrior before God, was the founder of the dynasty. I suppose there would be little interest if I were to recite the entire family tree. We will talk a little about the Old Dessauer, the old moustache, who was a successful general under two emperors and two kings. He played a foolish prank, in the eyes of his…

relatives, who were very proud of their ancestors, to where he fell in love with a

common girl, the daughter of a pharmacist, her name being Anna Foehsin, and he

(hen married her contrary to all arguments, made her into a reigning princess and lived

with her happily for a long time, and also made sure there were plenty of offsprings.

To possess her, he did not back down from anything, he even stabbed her alleged
lover, whom he found once in a kneeling position in front of her. For this, a common

Mortal would have been punished as a murderer, but since he stemmed from God’s
Grace, he was allowed to do this. More about his characterization is the following:
As he once, as an Austrian field general, returned from a war victoriously, he was
received by the people of a southern city with a fitting festive march (music), which
he liked so very much, that this march had to be played at each fitting occasion. He
did not want to hear anything else anymore, just the so-called ""Dessauer March"";
yes, even in church, when the entire congregation sang holy songs, he would shout
out loudly with his terrible bear voice the favorite march, for which the following text
was written by agenius:

This is how we live!
This is how we live!
This is how we live each day!
With the most beautiful drinking buddies!
In the morning with brandy,
At noon with beer,
In the evening with the virgins in their bedroom!

Even when he was on his deathbed they had to play this melody for him and he would
yell out the text along, until his last breath.

For a successor Franz, called by all his subordinates Father Franz, this was an
opportunity, being a quite tight and people loving prince, who had only the welfare
of his subordinates at heart and was against all military actions. His favorite pastime
was to travel through the land, on foot, to visit each village and town. He visited
each school to convince himself o the capability of the teachers and the progress of
the students. He walked each street and lane and talked with all he met, regardless
if they were rich or poor, noble or common.

His successor, Duke Leopold Friedrich, was again the opposite. He was people shy,
did not care about the government, left everything to his advisors, who exploited the
land the citizens in the most shameless way. His only passion was to hunt every day,
to cross through the woods back and forth was the only hobby he had. No wonder
then, that in the year 48 the exploited people welcomed the Revolution.

Ss vil, | want to tell about a princess from Anhalt, who was meant to play a big role in
world history. She was selected to be the wife of the Russian Emperor Paul, and
when he died, he was a very unimportant human moron, she became Emperor of
Russia under the name Katharina Il. World history teaches us that she enlarged the
Russian State quite a lot and broadened its borders and reached the highest step on
the ladder to power. Therefore, she was called ""Katharina the Great"". The famous
historian, Johannes von Mueller, says about her: She was great, if greatness could",3.3809192180633545,0.0035889070146818925,0.016216216216216217,images/IMG_8480.jpg,True,,,,,

He no longer wanted to hear anything else—only the so‑called “Dessauer March”; indeed, even in church, when the entire congregation sang hymns, he would shout out, in his terrible, bear‑like voice, his favorite march, for which a genius wrote the following words:

So, I want to tell about a princess from Anhalt who was destined to play a major role in world history. She was chosen to be the wife of the Russian emperor Paul, and when he died—an utterly insignificant, foolish man—she became empress of Russia under the name Catherine II. World history teaches us that she greatly enlarged the Russian state, broadened its borders, and climbed to the highest rung on the ladder of power. Therefore she was called “Catherine the Great.” The famous historian Johannes von Mueller says of her: She was great, if greatness could—

Note: If you want historical accuracy, Catherine the Great married Peter III, not Paul; Paul was her son.

places to med at the causes which led to sucha general people uprising and in many
@ bloody revolution. In the year 1847 all food in Germany was very,
very expensive. A bushel of rye cost five Thalers, a price which was unattainable,
because alf wages were so low and all earnings so low, as to where the mass of the
People had to go hungry, while the officials lived high on the hog. In the spring of the
same year, | had to go to work, together with several of our journeymen, ata mill for
fourteen weeks. The milf was called Amts Mill, located near the city of Zerbst.
There, we did not feel anything of the expensive times, we had plenty to eat, and
when we were finished there, we went to Jochheim, a forestry located near the Elbe
river, about three hours from Zerbst. The forester’s name was Ganzer and his ranger,
@ unique individual first class, was called Fritz Otto. As good as life was at the mill,
at the forestry we lived like masters. Here is the menu: early, six o‘clock, coffee,
Sugar, milk, butter and hard rolls in masses. At eight o'clock breakfast, bread, butter,
coffee, ham, meat and beer, and for master and journeymen brandy too. /, as an
apprentice, did not get any brandy. At eleven thirty was lunch. Soup, vegetables,
meat, roast, salad, bread, beer and brandy. At two o'clock, coffee, sugar, butter and
hard rolls. At four o'clock was afternoon snack. Bread, butter, wurst and such, beer
and brandy. At six thirty was dinner; again roast, bread, butter, cheese, meat, beer
and brandy and at each meal everything was available in masses. See! such was the
live of the officials. At this site, the poor workmen had their mouths and noses wide
open. No wonder that unhappiness reigned all through the land and the question
arose. Aren't we commoners and workers human beings too, are we only here to
carry the load and pay taxes? The old forester Ganzer and his wife were the most
deserving people in the world. She, the forester’s wife, always asked us to go into
the garden and to pick for ourselves there berries, fruit and grapes as much as we
liked, there was plenty of all of these things there, so we did not have to go hungry.
The forester was a very friendly and entertaining man and each evening, when he was
not absent, all people who lived in the house and in the neighborhood gathered

outside.

‘lr. Forester sat in the middle, everyone listened with attention. Then he finally
began. Now / have to tell you a story, you have probably never heard one like it in
your entire life, a story of the poisonous tree on the island Celebes and he elaborated
long and wide about the terrible consequences the fumes of this poisonous tree had.
The birds fell as corpses dead from the air; wild animals, which roamed near the
poisonous tree, collapsed dead and the people, who dared to get close to it because
of ignorance, also had to die and this way, during the course of many years, sO many
corpses had gathered near the tree, so that the resulting poisonous smell due to the
decomposition of the corpses made it impossible for any living creature to live on the
island. And as long as we were there, he told this same story every evening as if it

Now that we have closed the characterization of some of the princes of Anhalt, we will look at the causes that led to such a general uprising of the people and, in many places, a bloody revolution. In the year 1847, all food in Germany was very, very expensive.

At eleven-thirty was lunch: soup, vegetables, meat, roast, salad, bread, beer, and brandy. At two o’clock, coffee, sugar, butter, and hard rolls.

At six-thirty was dinner: again roast, bread, butter, cheese, meat, beer, and brandy—and at each meal everything was available in abundance. See, such was the life of the officials. At this sight, the poor workmen stood with their mouths agape. No wonder that unhappiness reigned throughout the land, and the question arose: Aren’t we commoners and workers human beings too?

Birds fell dead from the air; wild animals that roamed near the tree collapsed; and people who, out of ignorance, dared to approach it also died. Over the course of many years, so many bodies had accumulated near the tree that the poisonous stench from their decomposition made it impossible for any living creature to remain on the island.

the story was told, the congregation broke up slowly and what was the most unusual
(hiNgs was, that in my opinion in those days, everyone left in pairs. The Forester with
his Mrs. Forester, the hunter, “Otten Fritze” by name, with Aunt Gertchen, our master
together with the already aging Aunt Minna, the journeyman with the female cook,
the servant with the chambermaid and this way also the neighbors, all left paired up.

amazements in regard to what made these pairs leave together, one pair going in this
direction, one pair in the other direction and all had chosen densely grown over spots.

success, she did not want to and so we just stayed sitting alone together and spent
the time in joyful discussions until it was time to go to bed. | really found life in the
country very relaxing, social, we all liked one another, and the Poet is definitely right,
when he sings: ""Girl from the country, how good you truly are! How the color of
virginity suits you so well!"" And so forth.

Now, everything in the world has an end, and so our time also ended and we had to
return to the city, had to say good bye to all the nice people, the beautiful deer roasts
and carps, and the masses and fill and excess of everything, and the life filled with
hunger began again for the master.

Fall of 1847 had arrived. No one, namely among the common people, had an idea
that such important political events prepared themselves, and there even were several
indications, which pointed to something very unusual. For example, in our city Zerbst,
stood since God knows when a huge sandstone sculpture which was to portrait the
Knight Roland. Helmet on his head, the sword in his fist. As | was taught, he is
supposed to be standing in seven German Cities and is supposed to mean, that
wherever such a Roland figure is standing, there is a high court, an assize in
existence. The City Council of Zerbst had decided, since the down was very rich, to
have a very artistic sentry-box built for Knight Roland and gave the order to execute
this plan to a builder named Wilhelm Raedike. He was a very rich and well to do man.
He employed many craftsmen and sculpturers, money was not held tight, only to build
a beautiful monument. As the enclosure fell, everything stood there in mighty beauty.
Everyone was amazed, was jubilant and happy about this very beautiful and expensive
building, but yet a murmur went through the crowd, as if something illegal had
happened, but no one knew what it was. Then finally it was brought to the surface.
A joker, who must have been informed in detail, had written a sarcastic poem and had
posted and distributed the same in the darkness of night, without anyone knowing

aboutit. This poem brought forth a storm of surprise, applause, but also upset. It
went like this:

And other threw up,
Your mouth stayed locked.

The wages for such loyalty, -
Did also not stay away totally.
The Council had decided,
To give out a sum of money,
To build a sentry-box.

And when the building was completed,

Then the house was too small.

With him were the smart spirits,
Regardless, he has to enter.

My heart is still bleeding,

Your buttocks into pieces.

Time will heel all wounds,
Soon you will recuperate,

lampoon and dared to put his weaknesses and sins on the pillory. Spread all over the
entire country the following poem appeared:

The Duke Leopold of Anhalt
Called the Tight One,
Gives money to his subordinates
But not the middle class.

So, not much comes during the day or night
Back from the woods,
And places the well being and luck of the middle man",2.804292917251587,,,images/IMG_8483.jpg,False,,,,,

When lovers kissed
and others retched,
you kept your mouth shut.

The wages for such loyalty
were not long in coming.
The Council resolved
to grant a sum of money
to build a sentry box.

And when the building was finished—
on which much money was wasted—
the little house proved too small.

“Oh my!” the master cried;
with him were clever fellows.
Still, he had to go in.

Then the ruffians hacked—
my heart still bleeds.
They did not miss:
they cut your backside to pieces
and left a gaping hole.

Be patient, you poor,
battered knight;
time heals all wounds.
Soon you will recover—
perhaps it will even grow back.

All attempts to find the culprit who so embarrassed the honorable Council and its worthy builder came to nothing. The builder suffered most, for wherever he showed himself he was mocked; even the children in the street shouted after him, “Ham thief! Ham thief!” Yet the best was still to come: the spirit of ’48 was in the air. In that year one of the mockers even dared to attack the reigning Duke, Leopold Friedrich, in a secret lampoon, pillorying his weaknesses and sins. The following poem was spread throughout the land:

Duke Leopold of Anhalt,
called the Tight-Fisted,
gives money to his underlings
but not to the burghers.

So little comes, by day or night,
out of the forests,
and the welfare and fortune
of the middling sort are at stake.

Notes on wording:
- heel → heal (time heals all wounds).
- house → hut/booth can work here; “sentry box” is fine.
- Barbarians → ruffians/louts fits the tone.
- Tight One → Tight-Fisted (stingy).
- subordinates → underlings/courtiers.
- middle class → burghers or middling sort (period flavor).
- back from the woods likely refers to timber/wood supply; “out of the forests” is a natural phrasing.

Poem: The Might of the Officials

The councilmen see themselves in ecstasy,
Having reached their long-sought goal,
And, playing with the middlemen’s possessions,
They play a very vile game.

Who does not know the tyrant,
The chamberlain of Mohs?
He is the miller’s patron saint,
For Bunge steals wholesale.

When his millstone grows dull
And all the flour is gone,
He fills the empty chest
With sawdust once again.

But you, Duke, we beg:
Lay aside your hunting clothes;
Rule here, and hunt and drive
The crooks clear out of the land.

Prose (revised)

The effect of this outspoken poem was tremendous. Popular feeling toward the nobility—the reigning dukes—was deeply deferential; no one could imagine such audacity to be possible. No one dared to speak of it in public. Only this much was sure: people thought the person who had done such a thing a very bad subject and a very daring human being. No one ever knew who the culprit was. How little the masses knew that momentous events were approaching—I want to give an example.

At the beginning of March, I was working with my master for a hat-maker—the people called him a “head shoemaker”—a rich, respected citizen named Fritz Rost. His nickname was Always-Green because, despite his white hair, he still pulled grand pranks, just like a youngster. As noon approached, we—my master and I, his apprentice—were invited to lunch. There were other guests at the table: mill owners from the surrounding area who had come to town on business. All were wealthy, well-to-do people whom one would expect to be well informed about current affairs.

Soon the talk turned to politics and the February Revolution in France, where they wanted to establish a republic and drive out King Louis‑Philippe. These were the main subjects of discussion. All agreed that the French were splendid fellows and that such a thing would never be possible here in Germany, especially in Anhalt. “Because,” they said, “if someone here spoke out in public and used improper words, he would soon be seized by the collar and thrown into a cell; and at once the others would shout, ‘Serves him right! Why can’t he keep his mouth shut?’ Right—imagine such a thing; the people are not yet politically mature.” Thus spoke rich, respected citizens who had traveled all over the country—people you would think would be well informed about public affairs.

Notes on key fixes (if helpful):
- Corrected vocabulary and spelling: ecstasy, tyrant, millstone, Louis‑Philippe.
- Idiom and collocations: lay aside your hunting clothes; rule here; hunt and drive out; well-to-do; current affairs.
- Clarified garbled phrases: seized by the collar; thrown into a cell; keep his mouth shut; politically mature.
- Smoothed syntax, punctuation, and paragraph flow.

Rewritten passage:
No one had any premonition that a total overthrow of the existing political order was so near.

It was a Saturday, 17 March. Early in the morning the barber—Franz Habusch was his name—came into our workplace to shave all the apprentices, as he usually did. When he was finished, he stood up and shouted, “Now, all you apprentices—and you journeymen as well—form ranks; I have something very important to tell you. This evening everything will break loose!” “What?” we all cried. “You’ll see—so be ready. You journeymen will have to fight for freedom and justice; you must be prepared to sacrifice everything, even your lives. The time has come to topple tyranny and build a free people’s state. You apprentices must come too: smash the windows and stand ready to help. Once more—I need your word and your handshake that you will do your duty. I’ve no time; I still have much to do today and must prepare as many people as possible for the great events. Good morning—and all of you, come!”

We journeymen and apprentices stood there, unsure what to think. The day passed in hope and hesitation. We ate our lunch; nothing out of the ordinary happened in the streets, and we thought he must have been joking. As we sat with our master at the supper table—on Saturdays we eat an hour earlier, at six—suddenly everything broke loose in the streets: a shrill whistle that cut through your bones; people running and shuffling; drumbeats so loud that the food stuck in our throats. We stared at one another in horror and amazement and rose, ready to rush outside. But our master—he was a master cabinetmaker and a man loyal to the government—stood and ordered us to stay. “Journeymen,” he said, “something unlawful is afoot. I warn you: do not take part, but remain quietly at home. What is coming tonight can only end badly and may weigh on a person for the rest of his life. Please heed my warning; I speak to you as an experienced man and a friend. And you apprentices, I forbid you to leave the house. Stay here and go to bed.”

It was easy for him to preach, but the noise in the street grew louder, and the journeymen, trembling with excitement, could think of nothing more urgent than to put on their coats and hats and rush into the tumult. We boys looked at one another speechless; the shouts in the street were ever more enticing, and so we too ran outside—come what may. We slipped between the houses, through the passageway, climbed over the gate, and there we were, out on the street, right in the middle of the chaos.

What struck us at once was that everyone was smoking, for until then a strict police ban punished smoking in the street with a heavy fine. Everyone was smoking.

Notes on key corrections:
- break lose -> break loose
- form up in ranks -> form ranks
- freedom and right -> freedom and justice
- people state -> people’s state
- stand by readily -> stand ready
- food got stuck in our mouths -> the food stuck in our throats
- skirt -> coat (German Rock = coat/frock)

Brief summary
- A first-person narrator describes riots during March 1848: a mob destroys the mayor’s house, releases and chases the horses, then raids the wine cellar and gets drunk, ending the rampage by evening on 18 March.
- The next day, unrest spreads across towns and farms, with crowds demanding freedom and freedom of the press.
- On 19 March, a ducal carriage seizes the appeals councilman Ludwig Habicht “dead or alive” and rushes him to Dessau to appear before the Duke.

Duke: Who in the whole land can calm this storm and reinstate law and order? They say you are the only man in the world who can do this. Answer—can you do it?

Habicht: Yes, Your Highness, I can do it.

Duke: How do you want to begin? How do you want to do this?

Habicht: Your Highness, that is my business.

Duke: What do you ask for?

Habicht: Unconditional power over the military and civilians—over life and death. The Duke’s house is an exception.

Duke: There is no other way?

Habicht: No, Your Highness.

Duke: Well then, you shall have unconditional power.

With shaking hands he wrote out the demanded power of attorney and signed his name to it.

Now Ludwig Habicht was close to the Duke—the most powerful person in the land—and all had to follow his orders. He did not bother with ceremony. He simply wrote, “I am ordering the General, the Major, or the Council of such-and-such,” and everyone had to obey.

The first thing he did was this: whenever he appeared in a village anywhere in the land, he ordered the entire population onto a large open area and addressed them as follows: “Citizens! I have come to advise you on the fastest way to obtain law and order. If you stand by me, I promise to buy you a house in which you can live very well. But I cannot do it alone—you must help me. Do you want to? If so, answer ‘Yes.’” And all shouted as in a choir: “Yes! We want this with goods and blood!” “Thank you,” he said, “for your promise. So let’s get to work. You must organize yourselves. First of all, you have to build a citizens’ army; each part of the city needs one company. Select a major for each company, and over all of them, select a city commander. I will supply the weapons. Well then, let’s get right to work! Most importantly, create law and order. I will see you again soon. For now, farewell. I don’t have any more time now; I have to get around the entire country and personally speak with all the citizens. Again, thank you for your willingness. Farewell!” And off he galloped in the carriage, accompanied by the crowd’s cheering.

Immediately they got organized. For each part of the town they appointed a citizens’ army major—mostly stout, heavy citizens—and for the whole army a city commander. A pharmacist named Busse was elected. After the necessary guard posts were chosen and the leading men’s companions were designated as lieutenants, majors, and officers, they went to the Duke’s castle, where they received weapons. Since each citizen-soldier was very proud of his newfound honor, everything went well and got underway. The entire town and surrounding areas were patrolled, and I would have advised anyone not to go against the citizens’ army. With all of this, Minister Habicht had hit the bull’s-eye, and as if with a big stick, the revolution there had ended, and law and order again became the daily routine.

meetings and festivals were held and at all the festivals and gatherings there was
never a shortage of beer, beer, and again beer, and music and dance for ever, and
everything was free, without a price to pay by anyone, It was for everyone, all the
class differences went out the window. Everyone was on 4a first name basis, and if
someone said to a minister or other high official: Sir! that person would stand there
ail astonished and say: Please don't do this, we humans are all brothers. If there was
a gala ball, and there were many, and people of all classes attended, princes ana
princesses, the highest noble ladies and gentlemen were present with their entre
families and sat in a row with the common citizen women and girls, the malas and the
farm girls. Everything appeared in the greatest harmony, and if they played music for
dancing, the journeyman danced with the princess, the common soldier with the
citizen, the prince with the maid or the farm girl.

See, this is the way it was in 48, life like in paradise, only too bad that it did not last
iong. The Duke was willing to fulfill all the wishes of his subordinates. Here is
another example. The duke’s next oldest brother, Prince George, lived in Florence,
italy and since he had a yearly allowance of 18,000 Thalers, the citizens of Zerbst
would say: We have here the most beautiful castle in the country, Prince George
must move here in our area and spend his money here, and immediately the Prince
and his family with eight children moved here. Since | always had to work as
apprentice at the master cabinet maker's at the castle and this way we a/so had to
refurbish his furniture, which was scratched up from the trip, | had plenty of
opportunity to meet the Prince’s entire family. The Prince himself was a likable, very
friend!y old man, who walked around the whole town, ate lunch with the commoners,
eric. The oldest daughter had the title of Princess, the other children were only counts
and countesses, because the Prince in his second marriage had married a commoner,
a daughter of a musician from Dresden, who he promoted to Countess v. Erdmansdorf
through the Emperor of Austria, in order to make the marriage possible. All were very
friendly towards us workers and the greatest fun we had with the servants, who were
all /talians.

One Sunday, our precious Mother of the Land, the Duchess, had announced her visit
to Zerbst and at two o'clock in the afternoon, the entire population of the town and
the surrounding villages marched to greet her on the country road. The civil army
with musical notes and the farmers all on horseback, they all awaited her at the
""Kruemling"" (bend), named this way because the road makes a bend there. We saw
her Carriage already from far away. As she had approached far enough and a cheer
of thousand voices came out of each one’s throat, she stood up in the carriage and
said: | greet you all from my heart and invite you to come along with me to the rifle
range, where we will all have some fun. Another cheer and away we went, with
melodies and song, the precious Mother of the Land in our midst, off to the rifle
range. Arriving there we found 39 huge barrels of beer, not the usual ""kegs"", but big
huge barrels. Everyone had been tapped, crowned and plenty of glasses were
available. First of all she was handed a full glass and then everyone present stood

and singing and jumping around, the crowd broke up to get ready to gather again that
evening in the described Inns. Then they really got going and as ! already indicated
earlier, all social classes were presented and in each Inn, the royal lady made an
appearance, Sat down at a table in the middle of the dance hall and watched the
dancing crowd around her. And when the right time came, she got up, took a glass
of beer, toasted with all people standing close to her and yelled with a loud voice: To
your health, my children. And then she removed herself, accompanied by the
sounding joyous noise to visit another dance hall and to make her appearance there.
There were plenty of refreshments, and when the joyous crowd left in the early
morning hours, everyone had just one wish: Oh, if it would just always be like this.

See, this is how the revolution was killed in our beautiful land of Anhalt. No one ever
thought of rebelling against the authorities, and everything again became normal,
while in other towns, i.e. in Berlin, hundreds of dead remained on the barricades and
people called to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, also called the old Lehman, as he spoke to his
citizens in the courtyard of the castle, with their heads covered: ""Fritz the Slip up ""
So, everything went along its normal way in our town. At each festivity, there was
beer and beer again, this was ordered by the citizens themselves. They elected
representatives who made liberal laws and one year later, his highness, the Duke, said
to his almighty Minister: Habicht, | don’t need you anymore, / believe! can get along

Zvery lively industrial town in Musspreussen, just at the border to Sachsen, and
worked there. There / worked, fit and in high spirit, until all of a sudden, as we went
out on Sunday and ended up in the highly praised Sachsenland, we saw everywhere,
much to our amazement, the following writings posted: ""Off to Dresden. All men
able to use a gun, off to fight for freedom and rights."" On Monday morning, my
coworker Fritz Zachnit from Schlesion, and | quit our job and off we went to Dresden. ‘
Arriving in Dresden, we stood at the bridge over the Elbe river, heard the gun fire and
noise of the granades in town, and we were undecided about what we should do.
Then, all of a sudden, there was a division of Turners from Sachsen, waving a flag
and all carrying guns. Onward! they called out to us four workemen. Two weavers
from Chemnitz had joined up with us, and we marched with them. As soon as we
arrived at the bridge, there was a Wenden army marching towards us, and as we
wanted to turn back, we saw with shock, that one could not pass over the bridge
tinere anymore either, because the Prussian regiment Alexander came marching in .
Tnere was no more escaping now. Of course, the Turners tried to defend themselves,
bint all was for nothing, they were trapped in a terribly narrow place. The Wenden
proceeded with pointed bajonettes, one could not even think of successfully defending
oneself. Most of the Turners, as they hung on the bridge railing, had their hands
hacked off and they fell backwards into the Elbe river. The rest was taken prisoners
and thus also us four workmen. Since we did not have any weapons and our travel
papers were in order, they brought us to the police headquarters. There, they asked
us where we were going and they transported us out of the town.

What we saw along the way was horrible. They led us far around the barricades,
where there were still many, many armed people. Across from the Elbe bridge was
a big hotel, ""To the City Rom"", there - everything was destroyed, on the outer wall,
there wasn’t room enough to put one hand width between all the canon and grenade
hole marks. The hanging signs in the street were perforated with bullets. The fight
had taken its biggest toll at the gallery. And terrible stories were told about the
Wendens, that they entered the houses through the sewers and murdered the entire

population, defenseless women and children.

*.a.v then, uS workmen, Shaking form excitement, were taken across the border and
we were told, never to come back if we treasured our life. We marched forward to
Pirna, Schanda, into Sachsen Switzerland. We could not climb the Koenigstein
(mountain) since the exiled King stayed there. The Sachsen Switzerland is such that
if someone who has never seen this part of the country could hardly imagine it. The

I set out for Dresden with my knapsack on my back and my walking stick in my hand, together with a travel companion from Halle; a guidebook to Dresden lay in my pocket. My only sister Johanna—who died already in 1856—the wife of a rifleman, accompanied us for about an hour. My dear mother, now deceased, had given me the large sum of five thalers as traveling money. Now everything was taken care of. Good‑bye! Good‑bye! A kiss—come back home healthy—and off we went, filled with happy courage, out into the wide world.

We took the road via Aken, Köthen, and Leipzig. There we parted; I went on to Eilenburg, a very lively industrial town in Prussia, right on the border with Saxony, and worked there. I worked, fit and in high spirits, until all of a sudden—out on a Sunday walk that led us into the much‑praised Saxon land—we saw, to our amazement, notices posted everywhere: “Off to Dresden. All men able to bear arms—off to fight for freedom and rights.” On Monday morning my coworker, Fritz Zachnit from Silesia, and I quit our jobs and set off for Dresden.

Arriving in Dresden, we stood at the bridge over the Elbe, hearing the gunfire and the crash of grenades in the city, unsure what to do. Then a company of Turners from Saxony came by, flag waving and rifles on their shoulders. “Onward!” they called to us four workmen. Two weavers from Chemnitz had joined us, and we marched with them. No sooner had we reached the bridge than a Wenden force was advancing toward us; when we tried to turn back, we saw, to our shock, that the Prussian Alexander Regiment was marching in on the bridge as well. There was no escape. The Turners of course tried to defend themselves, but it was no use; they were trapped in a terribly narrow place. The Wends advanced with fixed bayonets; any thought of a successful defense was out of the question. Most of the Turners, clinging to the bridge railing, had their hands hacked off and fell backward into the Elbe. The rest were taken prisoner, and so were we four workmen. Because we were unarmed and our travel papers were in order, they brought us to police headquarters, asked us where we were going, and escorted us out of the city.

What we saw along the way was horrible. They led us on a long detour around the barricades, where many, many armed men still stood. Opposite the Elbe bridge stood a large hotel, “Zur Stadt Rom” (“To the City of Rome”): everything there was destroyed; on the outer wall there was hardly a hand’s breadth of space between the cannon and grenade holes. The hanging signs in the streets were riddled with bullets. The fiercest fighting had been at the gallery. And terrible stories were told about the Wends: that they came up through the sewers into the houses and murdered the inhabitants—defenseless women and children.

We workmen, trembling with excitement, were then taken across the border and warned never to return if we valued our lives. We marched on to Pirna and Schandau, into Saxon Switzerland. We could not climb the Königstein, since the exiled king was staying there. Saxon Switzerland is such that anyone who has never seen it can hardly imagine it: the rolling hills, the shadowed valleys—a paradise on earth. This prompted me to …

worked there three weeks, we went to Insbruck, the capitol of Tyrol. Several things
Nappened on the trip there, and they are worth telling. As we walked in Salzburg
across the bridge over the Salza, a beautiful wagon was coming towards us. Riders
rode ahead of it, then the beautiful wagon, everything was covered with flowers. In

dress, so that we stood there speechless and though, that it could probably be the

Franz, the pottery maker, as his subordinates called him, accompanying, she was
carried to a resting place by the grave of Mozart, who was buried in Salzburg. After
we had seen everything, we went ahead to Hellbrunn. The Duke’s bishops of
Salzburg have created a paradise here, the likeness of which you'll never find

water was spraying and because the wealthy visitors, who left plenty of tips, should

of the nose and mouth of monsters, from the air, out of the ground, the water
sprayed in thousand streams down onto the poor devil, they cried out of anger and
the rich visitors laughed themselves half to death. Away we went, turned out back
on Hellbrunn, and stayed overnight at a farmhouse and the next morning we went to
Oberbaiern, Reichenhall, Berchdesgaden, across the steep mountain ridge called
Hirschbingel.

in overnight and the next morning we Started out. Our hosts had given us plenty of

bread, but we tried without success. We told the ""German Knight"" about our mishap.
He said: Have you already been to the Sachsen? We said no. Then he described to
use one more time where they lived, in the Laibacher Main Street. lt was already
getting dark but our needs pushed us to go on. Then, finally we found them, a big,
huge, grandiose house of the firm: ""Laboratorio di Faleynamie e Billardi e Eschebach

Fhrenberg! come in here, and he continued, | am introducing you to a fellow

Knight does not want to keep us without money. They said, go to the police, leave
your travel books there and bring us a Charta di Permanenza, then we will give each
of you an advance of one Gulden. We went and got it quickly and we each received

pytesseract_gpt5,"Here is a clean, copyedited version of your passage (preserving the original voice and details):

The area is a paradise, only it’s not for poor young workmen. If it had not been for the Jews and the Catholic priests, we would have starved. We often ran into soldiers who were returning from the Hungarian campaign. I have never seen a picture of greater sorrow and suffering. All were barefoot; the officers wore women’s skirts, their swords dangling from a string; that’s how they walked quietly along. The Austrian government was embarrassed to let these soldiers walk into the military post like this; therefore, they housed them in villages near the Adriatic Sea until they had new uniforms and had fattened up a bit.

So we finally arrived at Triest on Saturday after having experienced some hair‑raising things—starving, ragged, looking like bums. The innkeeper where we turned in—the inn was called “To the German Knight”—knew no mercy. He said, “So much trash comes here. Look for work, and then I’ll keep you.” “Okay, let’s look for work.” He sent us to a master named Koselik, named after the old railroad crossing barricades. There, hundreds of workers were employed, mainly in shipbuilding. As we arrived there, the foreman, a German, said to us: “We need many workers, but the German workers have all been let go because they did not want to work till eight o’clock anymore. I cannot employ any Germans until the owner gives permission, and he won’t be back till Monday.” So that was it for us for now.

Hungry and freezing, we returned to town, tried to beg for a piece of bread, but without success. We told the German Knight about our mishap. He said, “Have you already been to the Saxons?” We said no. Then he described to us once more where they lived, on the Laibacher Main Street. It was already getting dark, but our need pushed us to go on. Then, finally, we found them: a big, grand house of the firm “Laboratorio di Faleynamie e Billardi e Eschebach e Ehrenberg.” We rushed upstairs to the office. We said, “Two out‑of‑town carpenters are asking for work.” “We have work,” answered the man in the room. “Where do you come from?” he asked. My travel companion answered, “From Graz, Styria.” “And you?” he asked me. I said, “I am a Prussian.” “Where in Prussia?” he kept asking. I answered, “I’m really not a Prussian.” “Where are you from then?” he continued to ask me. “From Anhalt,” I said. “So, from Anhalt—where in Anhalt?” he asked me. I said, “From Dessau.” “From Dessau!” he cried, surprised. “That makes you a fellow countryman of my companion.” He tore the door open and yelled, “Ehrenberg! Ehrenberg! Come in here,” and he continued, “I am introducing you to a fellow countryman here.” General surprise, then happy handshakes, and the agreement that we would have work on Monday.

Well, this was all very nice and good, but the German Knight did not want to keep us without money. They said, “Go to the police, leave your travel books there, and bring us a charta di permanenza; then we will give each of you an advance of one gulden.” We went and got it quickly, and we each received one gulden as an advance and, feeling rich, we marched over to the German Knight.

Notes on key fixes:
- Replaced OCR symbols (/ and |) with the pronoun I and proper punctuation; corrected spacing (e.g., open arms, o’clock).
- Standardized place names to English forms: Prague, Copenhagen, Münster; Chemnitz, Saxony; Dessau (assumed “Dessay” was a typo).
- Smoothed awkward phrasing while preserving meaning (e.g., We would get free passage for “we will land for nothing”).
- “The Bishop from Muenster stopped him” seems off; based on context (the bishop later reimbursed them), I rendered it as supported him.

In the spring of 1852, | again got sand in my shoes and decided to travel together
with three others, a tailor, a shoemaker and a carpenter, to Amsterdam. We
celebrated our leaving, everyone promised by handshake to keep our project going and
to keep the continuing education club running. A large number of people
accompanied us to the outskirts of Bremen, for hours walking on a country road, we
sang another song and then said good bye. We were again wanderers. By way of
a part of Oldenburg and Hannover we arrived on Dutch territory and got aboard ship
in Harderwick near the Zuidersee. After a very story and dangerous trip we arrived
one evening in Amsterdam. In front of us were three brightly lit streets, | said: We'll
take the middle one, and after we had walked down the middle street quite a piece,
sorne one Called to us from a wine cellar: Germans! Come in here! lama young
man from Bremen, a good German, here you'll be treated well. We looked at each
other and in we went.

We had nothing to be sorry for there. We were treated very well there. The next day

we went to look for work and also found it. Well, to describe Amsterdam would fill

more than a book; here are just a few things. The town is built right in the middle

of water, all houses are on poles; the city hall is build on 60,000 poles. All streets

nave canals, through which the ships glide with full sails. There are only two solid
places in town, the Butter Market Place and the Place of the Mayor's house. Six

hunared bridges took care of traffic flow. And the population, one can hardly say, if
there is a pack of people who are more possessed by hate for the Germans.

Whenever we entered a public restaurant, sat down to get something to eat, everyone
moved far away from us. - Muff! Muff! they called us, that is the rude name for the
Germans. When we had a glass of wine which, by the way, was very small, they all
yelled: ""Can these guys drink"" and they too themselves drank schnapps by the quart.

One half of the population lived in huge palaces covered with silk, jewels, and money,

and the largest part of the population was poor, So poor, which we Germans could not
even begin to understand. There were places to sleep which consisted of a tightly
stretched tope over which the poor were hanging, sleeping. - With a wheel barrow
equipped with some type of rack, on top of that an iron plate and a few pots and
pans, they went from place to place and kept up this moving pitiful restaurant going,
below the heads of little children were peaking out and at night they would Stop at
a place protected from rain and storm. Many people there live this way. Drinking
schnapps, give in to their worse passions, complain about anything German, you Séé,
this is what we found in Amsterdam. No wonder, that it filled us with disgust and
sstonishment and so we left again after experiencing quite a few unpleasant things.
Suil in Utrecht, not far form the German border, they ran after us, Muff! Mufti they
called us. As we arrived at the Inn to spend the night, everyone stared at us and the
women screamed: Oh, the poor German boys, they want to get around in the world,
and at home they have nothing to eat. Our boys have it made compared to them,

They can stay at home; they do not have to starve. We had to endure all this in silence, and we were so happy the next morning when we were standing on German soil and saw old Father Rhine.

From there we set out upstream along the Rhine and went through the Eifel—such a beautiful region—until we could greet Father Rhine again at Mainz, Speyer, and romantic Germersheim on the Rhine; and thus we traveled with him by steamer. The shoemaker, the tailor, and I, a carpenter, rode overnight to find work there. After we had been there some time, we got sand in our shoes again. The tailor stayed; the other carpenter, my fellow countryman, went to Frankfurt a.M., and I set off with the shoemaker to travel to Switzerland. First we went to the Rheinpfalz, that beautiful land where the grapevines bloom. At Karlsruhe we took the train. Near Freiburg im Breisgau the police boarded, took our travel passes, and told us we could reclaim them at the Freiburg police station. When we arrived, the word was: “Turn back! You are not permitted to travel to Switzerland.” The shoemaker headed for Württemberg, and I went to work in Freiburg.

The poet is right about the Breisgau: the most beautiful region in the whole land—truly a paradise. It is indeed a blessed area. The aftermath of the revolution was still noticeable. By eight o’clock in the evening everyone had to be at home. Every half hour a patrol went through the streets—soldiers, then the citizens’ militia, then the fire brigade by turns. Whoever they found in the streets after eight received a free overnight stay, a grand meal with plenty of beer and wine, and everything very cheap. Then, just as I was feeling quite comfortable, a letter arrived from Bremen—from the Club, the Evening Entertainment. They begged me to come back to Bremen immediately. I wrote back: “If you send me traveling money, I’ll come.” And behold, by return mail I received ten thalers.

Well then, goodbye, beautiful Baden land. Off I went—via Karlsruhe, Mainz, Frankfurt a.M., Kassel, and so on—back to Bremen. There was great joy when the president of the Club returned. I went back to work there and faithfully fulfilled my duties to the Club; everything went smoothly. Our Club already had a reputation and had made a name for itself. Famous men visited us, delighted and surprised to find such an active, progressive club life. But the Reaction was in full bloom everywhere, and that was our ruin.

It was Holy Saturday, the night before Easter 1853, when I reached the inn in the afternoon. As I arrived, they rushed toward me: “Anton, they’ve been looking for you all day.” “Me? Who is looking for me?” “The police! Hurry and get out of Bremen before they catch you and lock you up.” I said, “I’m not leaving Bremen. I have committed no crime, and only a bad shepherd abandons his flock.” “Look, there—they’re coming back again: four policemen. They don’t know you by sight; just walk right between them and out of town.” Said and done: I walked, without a care, right between the policemen—but I resolved once more not to leave the city. I went to my room to get my suitcase. The innkeeper told me the police had already picked it up in the morning, so I went straight to the police station. I said to the officer on guard: “I am—”

I am the carpenter journeyman August Anton from Zerbst. “Come in,” he said. “We’ve been waiting on him for a long time; come in here.” And then I was inside four walls until the magistrate was called.

I had expected to receive an award; instead I faced punishment—even a sentence from the High Senate. I found myself subjected to interrogations and facing a dishonorable jail term. That’s all I have to say.

Total silence followed. The men put their heads together. The President came forward and said: “The sentence for the carpenter journeyman August Anton is hereby lifted; however, he will be escorted to the border by a policeman, banished from Bremen for 99 years, and ordered to return to his homeland.”

Several policemen took me and the club’s vice president, Hermann Franke [from …?], placed us between them, and off we went. As we crossed the cathedral courtyard (the Dom), it was filled with people. They formed a path and, as we marched through, they all shouted an enthusiastic “Hurrah! Live well, live well! You’ll come back to Bremen again!”

We were led across the bridge and then a bit farther. Our escorts stopped and said: “Now, we think you are brave fellows; you’ll find the way across the border by yourselves and won’t cause us any problems by coming back to Bremen.” We said we wouldn’t even think of it. “Well then, give us your hands and have a good trip.

I went into a workshop in the newer part of town where they made chairs. Everyone there was astonished; they formed a circle around me and asked what they could do for me. I said, “Give me some money and different clothes, because I want to go into Bremen one more time so the police won’t recognize me.” In no time I had everything, we shook hands, and I headed across the bridge back to the inn.

Father Roesemann was astonished. “Hurry,” he said. “Come into my private room.” I sat there until it got dark. Then I went to see her; we said goodbye, looked into each other’s eyes once more, and then it was time to part there as well.

The next morning, at five o’clock, I left in the company of a friend, Heinrich Deyen from Melle (near Bremen), and we marched another 17 hours to Nienburg on the Weser. The next morning we said goodbye to each other—he went to Melle and I went via Hannover, Braunschweig, and Magdeburg to Zerbst. My parents were amazed that I showed up so suddenly. The next morning I reported to the police station. “Welcome, Mister President!” everyone shouted. They took away my exile passport and informed me that I would remain under police supervision for one year and could not leave town.

A short time later I became very ill for several months, and I have to thank my late mother for her care; otherwise I might have died. Later, I worked again for a local master, met stage stars, and acted as a comedian because I was bored. When I had had enough of that, after I had helped to bury my dear father in 1854, I went to Berlin in 1855, worked there another three years, and had to admit to myself that I had been a real jackass for not coming to Berlin earlier.

Notes on unclear items I didn’t want to guess at:
- “Hermann Franke from [Fone recky baretully]” — source/origin unreadable.
- “Father Roesemann” — is this a priest or an innkeeper’s nickname? Context suggests a priest, but confirm.
- “exile passport” — likely a document related to expulsion; confirm the intended term.
- Final sentence: “went to draw … each time I had saved 100 thalers” — “draw” may mean drafting/design training; please clarify.

…seven miles out to the farm where Hans Mix lived—the same man I told Captain Raether about. He agreed, packed his things the next morning, and off we went to Tuscumbia, where we arrived on the holy night before Easter, 1877. We signed the contract in town, where Captain Raether was present with the realtor, and off we went to Spring Valley. We began to work the farm. I let two of my children, Fritz and Anna, come from Michigan, and everything was running smoothly at the beginning. The “Flour Mill” brought in the groceries we needed, and milk, eggs, and meat we already had enough of on the farm. But soon I realized that Mix was not the right man to run a big farm like this. Instead of setting himself on his horse like a German manager and driving the three workers who worked for us, he himself worked like a horse, and she too was a dumb, tight, crazy female. I stuck in there till August; then I had enough of Mix’s way of running the farm. I had the realtor, Roth, come out and asked him to release me from the contract. Captain Raether wanted to pay me for the work I had already done, but I said, I don’t want anything, nothing at all; I just want to be free and leave here. Then I was released from my responsibilities and went to Tuscumbia.

Here I began to work for a certain Mr. Challen, who owned a furniture store and also a workshop with a lot of machines.

Clean, polished version
We held our meetings at Professor Paling’s—he and his unforgettable wife always made us welcome.

The next thing was to start a sports club. A seventy-three-year-old tailor named Landgraf served as our instructor. Oh, what a life that was. Someone provided us with a gym near where the brewery stands today. When the cashier later ran off with eighteen dollars, the project took a hit. For a while everything went to sleep, until we gathered one evening at August Dunker’s—he ran a store on 14th Street in those days—and we started again to found a sports club. Our friend Weidemann became the coach. The first gym was on the South Side; then we met in the German Association’s hall, “Sublet Hall,” and later we moved to First Avenue. There we did sports and held festivities until the end came there too. Unpleasant events made it advisable for the club to suspend its activities. The board made that decision, and the equipment and all utensils were stored in the Schillinger Brewery until, after two years, a reorganization finally took place. By then there was a flourishing German club here—the German Association—a club full of life and activity.

Several members left that club in ’86 and founded a second German club; they said its name should be Concordia. Then the Sports Club came alive again under President Emil Lesser. Germans relaxed there; they sang; they enjoyed themselves, and German traditions were observed. And so it remains to this day. May God, well disposed toward the Germans, preserve these two German clubs here in Birmingham for a long time, so that both may blossom and grow and bear witness that wherever Germans live, German song and German traditions will be kept. I have the honor of having been a member of both clubs for many years, and even an honorary member of one.

Well, even though I have spent many long years in beautiful Birmingham, I have not been able to acquire money or property. But the love of my children and the respect of many of my dear friends and countrymen remain—friends from whom I have often received tangible proof of their affection through real help and devotion in times of trouble and illness. My most sincere wish is that it may remain so until the end of my life. I could probably write much more, but everything must come to an end one day, and so I have only one wish: that these written memories of my life will please my German friends and countrymen. Thanks are also due to the German religious societies; they stand for discipline, education, and humanity—the most important factors in human life—and I only wish that my health will allow me to spend time in their midst quite often. Though I can hardly ever go there, I am always among them in spirit, being the good Christian I am.

Notes and uncertainties
- “Sublet Hall” and “Schillinger Brewery” are left as in your text; confirm spellings if you have authoritative names.
- The opening line about “the preacher” was badly garbled; I smoothed it to a general welcome from Professor Paling and his wife. If you have the source line, I can restore it more accurately.
- Amounts, dates, and names (e.g., ’86; Landgraf; Weidemann; Emil Lesser; August Dunker) are preserved as given.
- If this relates to a Turnverein/Turner society, “sports” could be rendered as “gymnastics,” and “instructor/coach” as “Turnlehrer,” depending on how literal you want the translation.

Tell me if you prefer:
- A minimal correction version (original syntax preserved, only typos/punctuation fixed), or
- A historically flavored version (keeping 19th‑century tone), or

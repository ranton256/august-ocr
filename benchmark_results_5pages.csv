Notes
- Remove the stray closing quote after REFLECTIONS.
- “written as a result of the motivation of his friends” sounds natural as “written at the urging of his friends” or “inspired by his friends’ encouragement.”
- “published by the writer” is more idiomatic as “published by the author” or “self-published.”

Two quick questions to finalize:
1) Is “Eagle” your pen name or the publisher’s imprint?
2) Do you prefer “Memoirs,” “Memories,” or “Reminiscences” for the tone you want?",29.44481086730957,7.029197080291971,6.833333333333333,images/IMG_8478.jpg,True,,2.932873010635376,26.511937856674194,34.0,275.0,0.0027925000000000003

Memories, | will herewith fulfill the wish of my friends and only ask for your kind
indulgence, if my descriptions fail to be elegant. Well then, | will do the best / can.

Once upon a time, many, many years ago, in the old city of Zerbst, in the beautiful
‘and of Anhalt, located in the German homeland, a strong boy was born to an honest
Oraper by his mistress. This boy was later baptized in the reformed church and
received the name August. Now / cannot honestly remember all the details, only this
much was clear to me, that |! must be August. Now, the boy grew up, food and drink
Ne loved to taste and when he, because of his young ways, did some dumb pranks,
he then often received quite sensible memories from his father or his mother.

With my sixth year, | was sent to a so-called ""Winkel School” (Corner school) which
was run by an old Kantor widow named ""Durre"" and was assisted by her already
pretty mature daughter “Auguste”. Later, when the City Council of Zerbst had a huge
Stately building erected and designated jt to be a public school, all school-aged
children, from five to fourteen years old and to attend it and the “Winkel School”
ceased operation. At the examination, | received a report card: Accepted into first

The apprenticeship period lasted four years, 8 June 1848, after having passed my

To my friends and countrymen!

Urged by many to set down the memories of my life, as well as the events of the year ’48, insofar as they personally touched me, and to publish these recollections, I hereby fulfill my friends’ wish and only ask your kind indulgence if my descriptions are not elegant. Well then, I will do the best I can.

Once upon a time, many, many years ago, in the old city of Zerbst, in the beautiful land of Anhalt in our German homeland, a sturdy boy was born to an honest draper and his wife. This boy was later baptized in the Reformed church and received the name August. Now, I cannot honestly remember all the details; only this much is clear to me—that I must be August. The boy grew up; he loved to taste food and drink; and when, in his youth, he played some foolish pranks, he often received sensible reprimands from his father or his mother.

At age six I was sent to a so‑called “Winkel School” (corner school) run by the widow of an old cantor named Dürre, assisted by her already quite mature daughter, Auguste. Later, when the City Council of Zerbst erected a large, stately building and designated it a public school, all school‑aged children, from five to fourteen, had to attend it, and the Winkel School ceased operation. At the entrance examination I received a report card: Accepted into first grade on a trial basis! I went there for the next five years, and in the last two years I was the top student.

In 1844 I was confirmed, and now it was time to choose a profession for life. I would have loved to become a fur tanner; however, I was unable to find a master to teach me. In 1842 I had begun an apprenticeship with my mother’s brother, who was a master fur tanner, and I worked for him during my free time when I did not have school. I had to be confirmed first; but before I could be confirmed, he died. Since I could not find another master, though I tried very hard, I began my apprenticeship with Franz Wiegand, the best cabinetmaker around. The apprenticeship lasted four years. On 8 June 1848, after passing my examination, I was declared a journeyman carpenter, and the presiding court assessor took my word and handshake and charged me to travel to foreign parts, to see other cities and countries, so that, when the time came, I might become a capable master of the trade and a good citizen. That I have honestly done; but before I tell of it, I would like first to speak a little about the beautiful land of Anhalt and then about the events of the year ’48.

During the beautiful pre‑March era, the reigning princes of our German fatherland were the A and O—the Alpha and the Omega—the sun around which everything revolved. I would like to be permitted to describe some of our former rulers. “Albrecht the Bear,” a mighty warrior before God, was the founder of the dynasty. I suppose there would be little interest if I were to recite the entire family tree. We’ll speak a little of the Old Dessauer, the Old Mustache, who was a successful general under two emperors and two kings. He committed what, in the eyes of his—

Notes and small queries:
- draper: Your text has “Oraper,” which looks like an OCR error. If it should be a different trade, tell me and I’ll correct it.
- mistress: I’ve rendered this as “wife,” which matches the likely meaning “mistress of the house” rather than “lover.”
- carpenter officer: I’ve updated this to “journeyman carpenter,” the standard term after an apprenticeship.
- During the beautiful pre‑March time: “pre‑March” reflects the German Vormärz (pre‑1848 period).
- Winkel School: historically a small private “corner school,” often of modest quality.

If you prefer a version that keeps more of the original phrasing, or a fully modern paraphrase, say the word and I’ll adjust.",80.14981532096863,0.45546683046683045,0.5131147540983606,images/IMG_8479.jpg,True,,3.8209242820739746,76.32889103889465,815.0,997.0,0.01098875

relatives, who were very proud of their ancestors, to where he fell in love with a

common girl, the daughter of a pharmacist, her name being Anna Foehsin, and he

(hen married her contrary to all arguments, made her into a reigning princess and lived

with her happily for a long time, and also made sure there were plenty of offsprings.

To possess her, he did not back down from anything, he even stabbed her alleged
lover, whom he found once in a kneeling position in front of her. For this, a common

Mortal would have been punished as a murderer, but since he stemmed from God’s
Grace, he was allowed to do this. More about his characterization is the following:
As he once, as an Austrian field general, returned from a war victoriously, he was
received by the people of a southern city with a fitting festive march (music), which
he liked so very much, that this march had to be played at each fitting occasion. He
did not want to hear anything else anymore, just the so-called ""Dessauer March"";
yes, even in church, when the entire congregation sang holy songs, he would shout
out loudly with his terrible bear voice the favorite march, for which the following text
was written by agenius:

This is how we live!
This is how we live!
This is how we live each day!
With the most beautiful drinking buddies!
In the morning with brandy,
At noon with beer,
In the evening with the virgins in their bedroom!

Even when he was on his deathbed they had to play this melody for him and he would
yell out the text along, until his last breath.

For a successor Franz, called by all his subordinates Father Franz, this was an
opportunity, being a quite tight and people loving prince, who had only the welfare
of his subordinates at heart and was against all military actions. His favorite pastime
was to travel through the land, on foot, to visit each village and town. He visited
each school to convince himself o the capability of the teachers and the progress of
the students. He walked each street and lane and talked with all he met, regardless
if they were rich or poor, noble or common.

His successor, Duke Leopold Friedrich, was again the opposite. He was people shy,
did not care about the government, left everything to his advisors, who exploited the
land the citizens in the most shameless way. His only passion was to hunt every day,
to cross through the woods back and forth was the only hobby he had. No wonder
then, that in the year 48 the exploited people welcomed the Revolution.

Ss vil, | want to tell about a princess from Anhalt, who was meant to play a big role in
world history. She was selected to be the wife of the Russian Emperor Paul, and
when he died, he was a very unimportant human moron, she became Emperor of
Russia under the name Katharina Il. World history teaches us that she enlarged the
Russian State quite a lot and broadened its borders and reached the highest step on
the ladder to power. Therefore, she was called ""Katharina the Great"". The famous

He visited each school to satisfy himself of the capability of the teachers and the progress of the students.

His only passion was to hunt every day; crossing through the woods back and forth was his only hobby. No wonder, then, that in 1848 the exploited people welcomed the Revolution.

So I want to tell you about a princess from Anhalt who was destined to play a big role in world history. She was selected to be the wife of the Russian Emperor Paul, and when he died—he was a very unimportant, foolish man—she became Empress of Russia under the name Catherine II. World history teaches us that she greatly enlarged the Russian state, broadened its borders, and reached the highest step on the ladder of power. Therefore she was called “Catherine the Great.” The famous historian Johannes von Mueller says about her: “She was great, if greatness could”

ook nt close the characterization of some of the princes of Anhalt, now we will
places to med at the causes which led to sucha general people uprising and in many
@ bloody revolution. In the year 1847 all food in Germany was very,
very expensive. A bushel of rye cost five Thalers, a price which was unattainable,
because alf wages were so low and all earnings so low, as to where the mass of the
People had to go hungry, while the officials lived high on the hog. In the spring of the
same year, | had to go to work, together with several of our journeymen, ata mill for
fourteen weeks. The milf was called Amts Mill, located near the city of Zerbst.
There, we did not feel anything of the expensive times, we had plenty to eat, and
when we were finished there, we went to Jochheim, a forestry located near the Elbe
river, about three hours from Zerbst. The forester’s name was Ganzer and his ranger,
@ unique individual first class, was called Fritz Otto. As good as life was at the mill,
at the forestry we lived like masters. Here is the menu: early, six o‘clock, coffee,
Sugar, milk, butter and hard rolls in masses. At eight o'clock breakfast, bread, butter,
coffee, ham, meat and beer, and for master and journeymen brandy too. /, as an
apprentice, did not get any brandy. At eleven thirty was lunch. Soup, vegetables,
meat, roast, salad, bread, beer and brandy. At two o'clock, coffee, sugar, butter and
hard rolls. At four o'clock was afternoon snack. Bread, butter, wurst and such, beer
and brandy. At six thirty was dinner; again roast, bread, butter, cheese, meat, beer
and brandy and at each meal everything was available in masses. See! such was the
live of the officials. At this site, the poor workmen had their mouths and noses wide
open. No wonder that unhappiness reigned all through the land and the question
arose. Aren't we commoners and workers human beings too, are we only here to
carry the load and pay taxes? The old forester Ganzer and his wife were the most
deserving people in the world. She, the forester’s wife, always asked us to go into
the garden and to pick for ourselves there berries, fruit and grapes as much as we
liked, there was plenty of all of these things there, so we did not have to go hungry.
The forester was a very friendly and entertaining man and each evening, when he was
not absent, all people who lived in the house and in the neighborhood gathered

outside.

‘lr. Forester sat in the middle, everyone listened with attention. Then he finally
began. Now / have to tell you a story, you have probably never heard one like it in
your entire life, a story of the poisonous tree on the island Celebes and he elaborated
long and wide about the terrible consequences the fumes of this poisonous tree had.

poisonous tree, collapsed dead and the people, who dared to get close to it because

decomposition of the corpses made it impossible for any living creature to live on the

Now, to close the characterization of some of the princes of Anhalt, we will look at the causes which led to such a general popular uprising and, in many places, to a bloody revolution. In the year 1847 all food in Germany was very, very expensive. A bushel of rye cost five thalers, a price that was unattainable, because all wages and earnings were so low that the masses had to go hungry, while the officials lived high on the hog. In the spring of the same year, I had to go to work, together with several of our journeymen, at a mill for fourteen weeks. The mill was called Amts Mill, located near the city of Zerbst. There, we did not feel anything of the expensive times—we had plenty to eat—and when we were finished there, we went to Jochheim, a forestry station located near the Elbe River, about three hours from Zerbst. The forester’s name was Ganzer, and his ranger—a unique, first‑class character—was called Fritz Otto. As good as life was at the mill, at the forestry we lived like masters.

Here is the menu: at six o’clock, coffee, sugar, milk, butter, and hard rolls in abundance. At eight o’clock, breakfast: bread, butter, coffee, ham, meat, and beer—and for the master and journeymen, brandy too. I, as an apprentice, did not get any brandy. At eleven‑thirty was lunch: soup, vegetables, meat, roast, salad, bread, beer, and brandy. At two o’clock: coffee, sugar, butter, and hard rolls. At four o’clock was the afternoon snack: bread, butter, wurst, and the like, with beer and brandy. At six‑thirty was dinner: again roast, bread, butter, cheese, meat, beer, and brandy—and at each meal everything was available in abundance. See, such was the life of the officials. At this sight, the poor workmen had their mouths and noses wide open. No wonder that unhappiness reigned all through the land and the question arose: Aren’t we commoners and workers human beings too?

Mr. Forester sat in the middle; everyone listened with attention. Then he finally began: “Now I have to tell you a story—you have probably never heard one like it in your entire life—a story of the poisonous tree on the island of Celebes.” And he elaborated at length about the terrible consequences of the fumes of this poisonous tree. The birds fell dead from the air like corpses; wild animals that roamed near the poisonous tree collapsed, and people who dared to get close to it out of ignorance also had to die.

the story was told, the congregation broke up slowly and what was the most unusual
(hiNgs was, that in my opinion in those days, everyone left in pairs. The Forester with
his Mrs. Forester, the hunter, “Otten Fritze” by name, with Aunt Gertchen, our master
together with the already aging Aunt Minna, the journeyman with the female cook,
the servant with the chambermaid and this way also the neighbors, all left paired up.
And only |, the apprentice, stayed seated alone with the bab ysitter, we exchanged our
amazements in regard to what made these pairs leave together, one pair going in this
direction, one pair in the other direction and all had chosen densely grown over spots.
| made a suggestion to her that we both should look for a spot ourselves, but without
success, she did not want to and so we just stayed sitting alone together and spent
the time in joyful discussions until it was time to go to bed. | really found life in the
country very relaxing, social, we all liked one another, and the Poet is definitely right,
when he sings: ""Girl from the country, how good you truly are! How the color of
virginity suits you so well!"" And so forth.

Now, everything in the world has an end, and so our time also ended and we had to
return to the city, had to say good bye to all the nice people, the beautiful deer roasts
and carps, and the masses and fill and excess of everything, and the life filled with
hunger began again for the master.

Fall of 1847 had arrived. No one, namely among the common people, had an idea
that such important political events prepared themselves, and there even were several
indications, which pointed to something very unusual. For example, in our city Zerbst,
stood since God knows when a huge sandstone sculpture which was to portrait the
Knight Roland. Helmet on his head, the sword in his fist. As | was taught, he is
supposed to be standing in seven German Cities and is supposed to mean, that
wherever such a Roland figure is standing, there is a high court, an assize in
existence. The City Council of Zerbst had decided, since the down was very rich, to
have a very artistic sentry-box built for Knight Roland and gave the order to execute
this plan to a builder named Wilhelm Raedike. He was a very rich and well to do man.
He employed many craftsmen and sculpturers, money was not held tight, only to build
a beautiful monument. As the enclosure fell, everything stood there in mighty beauty.
Everyone was amazed, was jubilant and happy about this very beautiful and expensive
building, but yet a murmur went through the crowd, as if something illegal had
happened, but no one knew what it was. Then finally it was brought to the surface.
A joker, who must have been informed in detail, had written a sarcastic poem and had
posted and distributed the same in the darkness of night, without anyone knowing

aboutit. This poem brought forth a storm of surprise, applause, but also upset. It
went like this:

“Many hundred years you have stood there
You grey man of stone,
You saw as the waves of storm

After the story was told, the congregation broke up slowly, and what struck me as most unusual was that, in those days, everyone left in pairs. The forester with Mrs. Forester; the hunter—“Otten Fritze” by name—with Aunt Gertchen; our master with the already aging Aunt Minna; the journeyman with the cook; the servant with the chambermaid; and so it was with the neighbors as well—everyone left paired off. Only I, the apprentice, remained seated alone with the babysitter. We exchanged our amazement at what made these pairs leave together—one pair going in this direction, one in that—and all of them choosing densely overgrown spots. I suggested that we look for a spot ourselves, but without success; she did not want to, and so we simply sat there together and passed the time in cheerful conversation until it was time to go to bed. I really found life in the country very relaxing and sociable; we all liked one another, and the Poet is definitely right when he sings: “Girl of the country, how good you truly are! How well the color of virginity suits you!” And so forth.

Now, everything in the world has an end, and so our time also ended, and we had to return to the city—had to say good-bye to all the nice people, the beautiful venison roasts and carp, and the abundance and excess of everything—and the hungry life began again for the master.

The fall of 1847 had arrived. No one, at least among the common people, had any idea that such important political events were in preparation, although there were several indications pointing to something very unusual. For example, in our city of Zerbst there stood, since God knows when, a huge sandstone sculpture intended to portray the Knight Roland—helmet on his head, sword in his fist. As I was taught, he is said to stand in seven German cities and to signify that wherever such a figure of Roland stands, a high court—an assize—exists. The city council of Zerbst, since the town was very rich, had decided to have a very artistic sentry box built for Knight Roland and gave the commission to a builder named Wilhelm Raedike. He was a very wealthy, well-to-do man. He employed many craftsmen and sculptors; money was not spared in the effort to build a beautiful monument. When the enclosure came down, everything stood there in magnificent beauty. Everyone was amazed, jubilant, and delighted with this very beautiful and expensive structure, yet a murmur went through the crowd, as if something improper had happened, though no one knew what it was. Finally it came to light. A joker, who must have been well informed, had written a satirical poem and had posted and distributed it in the darkness of night, without anyone knowing who it was. The poem provoked a storm of surprise and applause, but also outrage. It went like this:

“Many hundred years you have stood there,
you gray man of stone.
You saw the waves of storms
pass you by,
and also the sunshine.

You stood untroubled,
no evil assailed you.”
